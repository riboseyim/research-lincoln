# INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Lincoln stands, waiting. The only sound is the ticking of
the clock. And then the ticking is slowly drowned out as
bells begin to peal throughout the city. Lincoln raises the
window as Tad rushes to him. The bells are joined by a
cannonade. The sound of jubilation fills his office.

Lincoln turns from the window to Tad, who stares out eagerly,
seeking out the source of the noise. Lincoln puts his hand on
Tad's head. He looks down at his son, silent.
