# INT. THE SALOON ON BOARD THE RIVER QUEEN, HAMPTON ROADS,
VIRGINIA - DAY

Lincoln, Seward and the commissioners are seated. Seward looks concerned at Lincoln's fatigue.

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
Let me be blunt. Will the southern states resume their former position
in the Union speedily enough to enable us to block ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment?

			   LINCOLN
I'd like peace immediately.

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
Yes, and...?

			   LINCOLN
I'd like your states restored to their practical relations to the Union immediately.

Silence.

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
If this could be given me in writing, as Vice President of the Confederacy, I'd bring that document with celerity to Jefferson Davis.

			   SEWARD
Surrender and we can discuss reconstruction.

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
Surrender won't be thought of unless you've assured us, in
writing, that we'll be readmitted in time to block this amendment.

R.M.T. HUNTER
This is the arrogant demand of a conqueror for a humiliating,
			   ABJECT -

			   SEWARD
You'll not be conquered people, Mr.Hunter. You will be citizens, returned to the laws and the guarantees of rights of the Constitution.

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
Which now extinguishes slavery. And
with it our economy. All our laws
will be determined by a Congress of
vengeful Yankees, all our rights'll
be subject to a Supreme Court
benched by Black Republican
radicals. All our traditions will
be obliterated. We won't know
ourselves anymore.

			   LINCOLN
(a nod, then:)
We ain't here to discuss
reconstruction, we have no legal
basis for that discussion. But I
don't want to deal falsely. The
Northern states'll ratify, most of
\`em. As I figure, it remains for
two of the Southern states to do
the same, even after all are
readmitted. And I been working on
that.

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
Tennessee and Louisiana.

			   LINCOLN
Arkansas too, most likely. It'll be
ratified. Slavery, sir, it's done.

Hunter storms out of the cabin.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
If we submit ourselves to law,
Alex, even submit to losing
freedoms - the freedom to oppress,
for instance - we may discover
other freedoms previously unknown
to us. Had you kept faith with
democratic process, as frustrating
as that can be -


JOHN A. CAMPBELL
Come sir, spare us at least these pieties. Did you defeat us with ballots?

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
How've you held your Union together? Through democracy? How many hundreds of thousands have died during your administration? Your Union, sir, is bonded in cannonfire and death.

			   LINCOLN
It may be you're right. But say all
we done is show the world that
democracy isn't chaos, that there
is a great invisible strength in a
people's union? Say we've shown
that a people can endure awful
sacrifice and yet cohere? Mightn't
that save at least the idea of
democracy, to aspire to?
Eventually, to become worthy of? At
all rates, whatever may be proven
by blood and sacrifice must've been
proved by now. Shall we stop this
bleeding?
