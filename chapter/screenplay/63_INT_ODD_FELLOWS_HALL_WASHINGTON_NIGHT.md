# INT. ODD FELLOWS' HALL, WASHINGTON - NIGHT

Onstage, Gounod's Faust, Act Three, scene eight, the garden
outside Marguerite's cottage, a gorgeously romantic night.
MARGUERITE and FAUST are alone singing. The Lincolns, in
their box, watch quietly. Elizabeth Keckley sits next to
Mary.
87.

Mary turns to Lincoln. They speak in whispers. Mrs. Keckley
tries not to listen but she can't help hearing what they say.

			   MARY
You think I'm ignorant of what
you're up to because you haven't
discussed this scheme with me as
you ought to have done. When have I
ever been so easily bamboozled?
			   (BEAT)
I believe you when you insist that
amending the constitution and
abolishing slavery will end this
war. And since you are sending my
son into the war, woe unto you if
you fail to pass the amendment.

			   LINCOLN
Seward doesn't want me leaving big
muddy footprints all over town.

			   MARY
No one ever lived who knows better
than you the proper placement of
footfalls on treacherous paths.
Seward can't do it. You must.
Because if you fail to secure the
necessary votes, woe unto you, sir.
You will answer to me.
