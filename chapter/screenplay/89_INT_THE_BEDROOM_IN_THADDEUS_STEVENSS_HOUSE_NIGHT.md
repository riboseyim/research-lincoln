# INT. THE BEDROOM IN THADDEUS STEVENS'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Stevens, in his nightgown, takes off his wig. He's bald.

He lies down in bed. Mrs. Smith is in bed already beside him. She's holding the paper he gave her.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
I wish you'd been present.

			   LYDIA SMITH
I wish I'd been.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
It was a spectacle.

			   LYDIA SMITH
You can't bring your housekeeper to the House. I won't give them gossip.
			   (THE PAPER)
This is enough. This is... It's more than enough for now.

They kiss. He lies back. He grabs her hand.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
Read it to me again, my love.

			   LYDIA SMITH
			   "PROPOSED -"

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
And adopted.

			   LYDIA SMITH
Adopted. "An Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
Section One: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
			   SECTION TWO:

			   LYDIA SMITH
"Congress shall have power to enforce this amendment by appropriate legislation."

Thaddeus Stevens grins, nods, thinking, eyes sparkling.
