# INT. THE PRINCE OF WALES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lincoln enters a dark room, its heavy drapes closed against
the dim afternoon light. There are two beds. One is stripped
bare. The other is canopied with a thick black veil.

Mary, dressed in a deep purple gown with black flowers and
beading, perfectly pitched between mourning and emergence, is
seated at the head of the canopied bed. On a nightstand next
to the bed there's a toy locomotive engine, a tattered book
of B&O railroad schedules.

Mary holds a framed photograph: an image of WILLIE, 12,
handsome, bright-eyed, confident.

Lincoln crosses to the window.

			   MARY
My head hurts so.
			   (BEAT)
I prayed for death the night Willie
died. The headaches are how I know
I didn't get my wish. How to endure
the long afternoon and deep into
the night.

			   LINCOLN
I know.

			   MARY
Trying not to think about him. How
will I manage?

			   LINCOLN
Somehow you will.
54.

			   MARY
			   (SAD SMILE:)
Somehow. Somehow. Somehow... Every
party, every... And now, four years
more in this terrible house
reproaching us. He was a very sick
little boy. We should've cancelled
that reception, shouldn't we?

			   LINCOLN
We didn't know how sick he was.

			   MARY
I knew, I knew, I saw that night he
was dying.

			   LINCOLN
Three years ago, the war was going
so badly, and we had to put on a
face.

			   MARY
But I saw Willie was dying. I saw
			   HIM -

He bends and kisses her hand.

			   LINCOLN
Molly. It's too hard. Too hard.

Mary stares up at him, her face heavy and swollen with grief.
