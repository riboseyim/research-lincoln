# INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - MORNING, SEVERAL HOURS LATER

Thaddeus Stevens is at his desk. The House is in session, the
floor full of congressmen caucusing and arguing.

The balcony's packed. Mary and Keckley sit at the front,
Nicolay and Hay behind them. The Blairs are among other
officials, rich people, foreign dignitaries.

There's a sudden quiet, then murmuring. Ashley, Stevens and
everyone on the floor look up, Ellis, Hollister, Hutton and
Hawkins among these.

In the balcony, twenty WELL-TO-DO BLACK PEOPLE, mostly men,
are escorted by several Senators, including Sumner and Wade,
to a reserved section of the balcony. The black people glance
at their surroundings but are rigidly composed.

Asa Vintner Litton sees them enter. He looks about, at the
representatives caucusing, or staring up at the visitors.
Something powerful strikes him. In a voice coarse with
emotion, he calls up to the black visitors:
100.

ASA VINTNER LITTON
We welcome you, ladies and
gentlemen, first in the history of
this people's chamber, to your
House!

There's tense applause. Some of the black guests bow; most
aren't sure how to respond.

Yeaman watches this, deeply moved.

Bilbo catches Hawkins's eye and waves. Hawkins looks
anxiously around, blushing.

Everyone is seated, and the place is packed.

Schuyler Colfax is in his high seat atop the rostrum, the
SERGEANT-AT-ARMS to his right. Colfax gavels the House into
session. Ashley is at the podium.

			   SCHUYLER COLFAX
Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
On the matter of the joint
resolution before us, presenting a
Thirteenth Amendment to our
national Constitution, which was
passed last year by the Senate, and
which has been debated now by this
estimable body for the past several
weeks. Today we will vote...

Cheers, boos, applause.

JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D)
By mutual agreement we shall hear
brief final statements -

General cheering for this, laughing.

JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D)
- beginning with the honorable
George Pendleton of Ohio.

Applause, boos. Pendleton, taking the podium, is handed
several letters by Wood. He holds them over his head. The
chamber's quiet.

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
I've just received confirmation of
what previously has been merely
rumored! Affidavits from loyal
citizens recently returned from
101.

Richmond. They testify that
Commissioners have indeed come
north and ought to have arrived by
now in Washington City! Bearing an
offer of immediate cessation of our
civil war!

The chamber explodes. Through the ensuing ruckus:

			   FERNANDO WOOD
(to Ashley, fake shock:)
Are there Confederate commissioners
in the Capitol?

			   JAMES ASHLEY
I don't... I have no idea where
they are or if they've arrived or -

			   FERNANDO WOOD
If they've arrived?!

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
I appeal to my fellow Democrats, to
all Republican representatives who
give a fig for peace! Postpone this
vote until we have answers from the
President himself!

In the balcony, Hay and Nicolay exchange worried glances.

			   FERNANDO WOOD
Postpone the vote!

Ashley turns to Stevens: "DO SOMETHING!" as Pendleton's
Democrats begin to chant "POSTPONE THE VOTE!"

Mary, worried, looks from Mrs. Keckley to Preston Blair, who
is focused on the leader of the conservative Republican
representatives, AARON HADDAM (R, KY). Haddam looks up at
Preston, awaiting instructions.

Democrats and Republicans rush to the Speaker to support or
protest the motion.

In the balcony, Preston slowly stands, saddened and angry.

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)
I have made a motion! Does anyone
here care to second -

Preston nods at Haddam: "Go ahead." Haddam rises.
102.

			   AARON HADDAM
(in a powerful voice:)
Gentlemen.
The conservative faction of border
and western Republicans cannot
approve this amendment, about which
we harbor grave doubts, if a peace
offer is being held hostage to its
success. Joining with our
Democratic colleagues, I second the
motion to postpone.

The debate swells again as, in the balcony, Schell scribbles
in a notebook while Latham whispers furiously in his ear.
Latham rips the page out before Schell's finished; Bilbo
snatches it from him.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
Quick, man! Quick!

Bilbo pushes his way out of the balcony. Nicolay, then Hay,
follow on his heels. Mary sees this; she's concerned.
