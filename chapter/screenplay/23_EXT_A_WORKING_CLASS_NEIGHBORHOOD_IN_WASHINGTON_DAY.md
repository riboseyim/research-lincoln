#### EXT. A WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD IN WASHINGTON - DAY

Schell stands at the door of a small, grubby row house. He
presents the folio, warped from its beer bath, to WILLIAM
HUTTON(D, IN), eyes red from crying, dressed in mourning
black.

Hutton slams the door in Schell's face. A funeral wreath that
adorns the door falls to the ground. A daguerreotype attached
to the wreath depicts a young officer, Hutton's brother
Frederick.
