# INT. THADDEUS STEVENS'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Stevens is met at the door by LYDIA SMITH, a black woman in her fifties. As she helps him off with his coat, he takes a piece of paper from his pocket.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
A gift for you.

She takes it.

THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)
The greatest measure of the Nineteenth Century. Passed by corruption, aided and abetted by
the purest man in America.
