# INT. AN EMPTY CORRIDOR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE -
			  CONTINUOUS

On the way out, Lincoln tosses the gloves on a side table.
Slade grabs them, considers chasing after Lincoln, then
thinks better of it. He walks back towards the office. Then
some strange feeling stops him, and he turns around again.
Lincoln is walking away, past the petitioners' chairs, down
the empty hallway.

Slade watches till Lincoln turns the corner, and he's gone.
