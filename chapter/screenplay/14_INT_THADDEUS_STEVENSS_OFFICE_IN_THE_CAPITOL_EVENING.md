# INT. THADDEUS STEVENS'S OFFICE IN THE CAPITOL - EVENING

The room's redolent of politics, ideology (a bust of
Robespierre, a print of Tom Paine), long occupancy and hard
work. On the wall opposite a massive desk hangs a faded
banner: "RE-ELECT THADDEUS STEVENS, REPUBLICAN TICKET, 9TH
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, LANCASTER PENNSYLVANIA". At the desk
sits THADDEUS STEVENS (R, PA), 73, bald under a horrible red
wig, a gaunt, powerful face resembling Lincoln's, though
beardless and bitter.

In the office are Ashley, Speaker of the House SCHUYLER
COLFAX (R, IN), formidable Senator BLUFF WADE (R, MA), who's
never smiled, and ASA VINTNER LITTON (R, MD).

			   BLUFF WADE
Whalers?

			   JAMES ASHLEY
That's what he said.

			   BLUFF WADE
The man's never been near a whale
ship in his life!
			   (TO STEVENS:)
Withdraw radical support, force him
to abandon this scheme, whatever
he's up to - He drags his feet
about everything, Lincoln; why this
urgency? We got it through the
Senate without difficulty because

we had the numbers. Come December
you'll have the same in the House.
The amendment'll be the easy work
of ten minutes.

ASA VINTNER LITTON
He's using the threat of the
amendment to frighten the rebels
into an immediate surrender.

			   SCHUYLER COLFAX
I imagine we'd rejoice to see that.

ASA VINTNER LITTON
Will you rejoice when the Southern
states have re-joined the Union,
pell-mell, as Lincoln intends them
to, and one by one each refuses to
ratify the amendment? If we pass
it, which we won't.
			   (TO STEVENS:)
Why are we co-operating with, with
him? We all know what he's doing
and we all know what he'll do. We
can't offer up abolition's best
legal prayer to his games and
tricks.

			   BLUFF WADE
He's said he'd welcome the South
back with all its slaves in chains.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Three years ago he said that! To
calm the border states when we were-

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
I don't.

This confuses the room. Stevens turns to Vintner Litton.

THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)
You said "we all know what he'll do." I don't know.

ASA VINTNER LITTON
You know he isn't to be trusted.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
Trust? I'm sorry, I was under the misapprehension your chosen profession was politics. I've never trusted the President. I never

trust anyone. But... Hasn't he surprised you?

ASA VINTNER LITTON
No, Mr. Stevens, he hasn't.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
Nothing surprises you, Asa,therefore nothing about you is surprising. Perhaps that is why
your constituents did not re-elect you to the coming term.
(collecting his cane and
			   STANDING:)
It's late, I'm old, I'm going home.

Stevens limps to the door, opens it, and turns.

THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)
Lincoln the inveterate dawdler,
Lincoln the Southerner, Lincoln the
capitulating compromiser, our
adversary - and leader of the
godforsaken Republican Party, our
party - Abraham Lincoln has asked
us to work with him to accomplish
the death of slavery in America.
			   (BEAT:)
Retain, even in opposition, your
capacity for astonishment.

Stevens leaves, shutting the door. They watch him go, Ashley
excited, Litton unmoved, insulted, skeptical.
