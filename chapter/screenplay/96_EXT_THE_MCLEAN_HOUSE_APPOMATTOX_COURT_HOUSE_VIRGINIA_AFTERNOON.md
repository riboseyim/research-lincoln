# EXT. THE MCLEAN HOUSE, APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA -	AFTERNOON

OFFICERS OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMY stand around in
the afternoon sun. Everyone's solemn, even stunned by what's
just happened. No one is speaking.

### TITLE: APPOMATTOX COURTHOUSE, VIRGINIA

### APRIL 9, 1865

ROBERT E. LEE comes down the steps of the McLean house, as a
CONFEDERATE OFFICER brings his horse to him. His face is
blank. Lee mounts his waiting horse.

Lee should leave, having just surrendered to Grant inside;
but he's immobile. Some of the officers of both sides look at
Lee, some can't bear it. Lee tries out various expressions:
pride, defiance, blankness.

Grant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his
staff. Among them is Robert Lincoln.

Grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that
Lee's still there, astride his horse. Everyone looks at the
two men who look awkwardly at one another.

Then Grant removes his famous slouch hat. Everyone freezes
for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the Union
Army remove their hats.

Lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect. He raises
his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head. Then, pulling
slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away.
