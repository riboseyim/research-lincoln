# INT. THE BEDROOM IN PETERSON'S BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING

Mary is gently escorted into a tiny room. A small, hissing
gas jet in the wall bathes the scene with green light.

Stanton, Speed, GENERAL HENRY HALLECK and a MINISTER, are
standing. Welles sits by the head of the bed. DR. CHARLES
LEALE, a young army surgeon, and DR. ROBERT STONE, the
Lincoln family's doctor, stand uselessly by the foot of the
bed, while DR. JOSEPH BARNES, the Surgeon General, listens to
Lincoln's faint breathing.

Robert, in uniform, red-eyed, pale as a ghost, sits at the
bedside and stares at his father, barely breathing.

Lincoln lies in a crooked diagonal, his knees bent, on a bed
he's too tall to fit properly, clad only in a nightshirt.

Barnes moves his head closer, then closer. The room is
utterly still. Barnes takes out his watch, looks at the time,
softly clears his throat.

DR. BARNES
It's 7:22 in the morning, Saturday
the 15th of April. It's all over.
The President is no more.

No one talks, or moves.

Stanton looks at Lincoln's body.

			   STANTON
Now he belongs to the ages.

Robert begins to weep.

LINCOLN (V.O.)
Fondly do we hope, fervently do we
pray, that this mighty scourge of
war may speedily pass away.
