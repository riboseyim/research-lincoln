# INT. HALLWAY, LEAVING MARY'S BOUDOIR - NIGHT

Lincoln encounters ELIZABETH KECKLEY, a light-skinned black woman, 38, Mary's dressmaker and close friend, holding a dark-blue velvet bodice embroidered with jet beads.

			   LINCOLN
It's late, Mrs. Keckley.

			   ELIZABETH KECKLEY
(holding out the bodice:) She needs this for the grand reception.

Lincoln bends down to look at the intricate beading.

ELIZABETH KECKLEY (CONT'D)
It's slow work.

He nods, smiles, straightens up.

			   LINCOLN
Good night.

He continues down the hall. Mrs. Keckley starts to enter Mary's boudoir, then stops, sensing something amiss. She calls quietly after Lincoln:

			   ELIZABETH KECKLEY
(concerned, a little EXASPERATED:) Did you tell her a dream?
