# INT. THE EAST ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Mary, radiant, her charm turned to its brightest candlepower,
is greeting the Blairs, who are part of a long receiving
line. The Blairs proceed from Mary to Lincoln.

TITLE: GRAND RECEPTION

			   JANUARY 15

The enormous room is splendid, decked with garlands of
flowers, tall candelabra burning, flags from Army divisions.
An orchestra plays.

Lincoln and Tad stand together. Slade is near Lincoln. Mary's
a distance away from Lincoln, to his right.

Robert takes his place next to his mother, as conspicuous as
he'd feared he'd be in his civilian clothes.
55.

A sea of people surround the President and his family.
Nicolay, Hay and several clerks channel the crowd waiting to
greet the Lincolns into the line: wealthy people, many more
middle-class people, some working people and farmers, and
many officers and soldiers.

Tad watches his father shake hands. Lincoln is in his
element. He stands close to each person, touches each one
gently, stoops to be nearer them; he puts everyone at ease.

He's bothered only by the white kid gloves he's wearing. He
tugs at the right-hand glove.

			   WILLIAM SLADE
(with a glance in Mary's)
She's just ten feet yonder. I'd
like to keep my job.

Lincoln takes off the right-hand glove - his hand-shaking
hand - but keeps the other glove on.

Approaching Mary on the line, Stevens, Ashley, Senators Bluff
Wade and CHARLES SUMNER, all in formal wear except Stevens.

			   MARY
Senator Sumner, it has been much
too long.

			   CHARLES SUMNER
"Oh, who can look on that celestial
face and -"

Cutting him off, she pretends not to recognize Ashley.

			   MARY
And...?

			   JAMES ASHLEY
			   (CONFUSED)
James Ashley, ma'am, we've met
several times -

But she ignores him and greets Stevens.

			   MARY
(her Southern accent
becoming more lustrous:)
Praise Heavens, praise Heavens,
just when I had abandoned hope of
amusement, it's the Chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee!

Stevens bows to her.
56.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
Mrs. Lincoln.

			   MARY
Madame President if you please!
			   (LAUGHS)
Oh, don't convene another
subcommittee to investigate me,
sir! I'm teasing! Smile, Senator
Wade.

			   BLUFF WADE
			   (NOT SMILING:)
I believe I am smiling, Mrs.
Lincoln.

			   MARY
I'll take your word for that, sir!

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
As long as your household accounts
are in order, Madame, we'll have no
need to investigate them.

			   MARY
You have always taken such a
lively, even prosecutorial interest
in my household accounts.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
Your household accounts have always
been so interesting.

			   MARY
Yes, thank you, it's true, the
miracles I have wrought out of
fertilizer bills and cutlery
invoices. But I had to! Four years
ago, when the President and I
arrived, this was pure pigsty.
Tobacco stains in the turkey
carpets. Mushrooms, green as the
moon, sprouting from ceilings! And
a pauper's pittance allotted for
improvements. As if your committee
joined with all of Washington
awaiting, in what you anticipated
would be our comfort in squalor,
further proof that my husband and I
were prairie primitives, unsuited
to the position to which an error
of the people, a flaw in the
democratic process, had elevated
us.
57.

Lincoln, suddenly without anyone in line to receive, looks to
see the backlog forming behind the radicals. He notes the
exchange, but says nothing. Robert sees him looking.

			   MARY (CONT'D)
The past is the past, it's a new
year now and we are all getting
along, or so they tell me. I gather
we are working together! The White
House and the other House? Hatching
little plans together?

Robert leans in to her.

			   ROBERT
Mother?

			   MARY
What?

			   ROBERT
You're creating a bottleneck.

			   MARY
Oh!
			   (TO STEVENS:)
Oh, I'm detaining you, and more
important, the people behind you!
How the people love my husband,
they flock to see him, by their
thousands on public days! They will
never love you the way they love
him. How difficult it must be for
you to know that. And yet how
important to remember it.

She gives him a slight, lethal smile. He holds the look; his
poker-face yields to a barely perceptible smile, amused and
perhaps a little admiring.
