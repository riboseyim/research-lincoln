# INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Lincoln is at his desk, working, when Hay bursts in. Bilbo
appears in the doorway, beet-red and gasping for air.

Hay's too winded to speak. Bilbo holds out the note, limp
with sweat, and brings it to Lincoln. Lincoln reads it.

			   LINCOLN
This is precisely what Mr. Wood
wishes me to respond to?
103.

Tad runs into the room, excited by the commotion. He wraps
his arm around his father's neck, then tears wildly out of
the room.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
Word for word? This is precisely
the assurance that he demands of
me?

W.N. BILBO
Yes sir.

As Nicolay heaves into the room in last place, wheezing
terribly, Lincoln deliberates for a moment, then writes a
note. He blots, folds and hands it to Hay, who immediately
reads it, Nicolay looking on.

			   LINCOLN
Give this to Mr. Ashley.

Hay looks at Nicolay, who can't speak; he waves at Hay to
speak for him.

			   JOHN HAY
I feel, um, I have to say, Mr.
Lincoln, that this -
(annoyed, impatient, to
			   BILBO:)
Could you please just step
outside?!

W.N. BILBO
You gonna have a chat now, with
with the whole of the House of
Representatives waiting on that?

Nicolay continues gasping, trying to speak. He can't.

			   JOHN HAY
			   (TO LINCOLN:)
Making false representation to
Congress is, it's, um -

			   JOHN NICOLAY
It's, it's -

			   LINCOLN
Impeachable. I've made no false
representation.

			   JOHN HAY
But there are -
			   (WHISPERING:)
104.

There is a delegation from
Richmond.

			   LINCOLN
Give me the note, Johnnie.

Hay gives Lincoln the note. Lincoln takes it, holding on to
Hay's hand; with his free hand, Lincoln passes the note to
Bilbo.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
			   (TO BILBO:)
Please deliver that to Mr. Ashley.
