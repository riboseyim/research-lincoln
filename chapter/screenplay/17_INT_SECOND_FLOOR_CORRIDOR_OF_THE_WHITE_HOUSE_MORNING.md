INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

The corridor as usual is lined with petitioners. They've
lined up along both sides of the wall and are hooting,
laughing, clapping and cheering, egging on Tad as, with
furious concentration, he drives a cart pulled at
considerable speed by a large and seriously annoyed goat down
38.

the hall. White House doorkeeper and unofficial child-minder
TOM PENDEL follows, admonishing the petitioners as he goes.

			   TOM PENDEL
Please don't encourage this! Don't encourage this!

ROBERT LINCOLN, 21, enters from the stairs carrying several pieces of large and heavy luggage.

Tad sees him, jumps out of the goat cart, runs up to and
tackles Robert, causing him to drop his luggage. They embrace
as Pendel captures the goat and leads it away.

			   TAD
You're back you're back you're back you're back you're -

			   ROBERT
			   (LAUGHING)
I am. Your goat got big.

Robert disentangles himself from Tad and hands him a suitcase.

			   ROBERT (CONT'D)
Here, help me get one of these to my room.
(a nervous glance at the door to Mary's bedroom SUITE:)
Is she in there?

As Robert hoists the rest of the luggage himself, Tad chatters and A PETITIONER comes forward. He grabs the trunk as Robert's lifting it.

			   PETITIONER
Please, please.

Robert wrestles the trunk out of the man's grasp just as Mary
enters the hall and sees him.

			   MARY
He's here...
(calling down the hall:)
He's here, Mrs. Cuthbert! He's here!

			   (TO ROBERT:)
Robbie... Oh Robbie! Robbie!

			   ROBERT
			   (EMBRACING HER:)
Hi, mama. Hey. Hey...

			   MARY (CONT'D)
			   (OVERJOYED)
Oh!

She instantly eyes Robert's amount of luggage with suspicion.

MARY (CONT'D) TAD
You're only staying a few - but what's made everyone

			   (TO TAD:)
Go tell your father Robert's home!

			   TAD
Mr. Nicolay says daddy's secluded with Mr. Blair.

			   MARY
Tell him anyway.

Tad drops the suitcase and runs to the office. Mary strokes Robert's face, looking concerned.

			   MARY (CONT'D)
You forget to eat, exactly like him.

			   ROBERT
			   (LAUGHS)
No...

			   MARY
You'll linger a few days extra, after the reception, before you go
back to school.

			   ROBERT
Well, I don't know if I'm gonna go back to -

She stops him with an alarmed look.

			   MARY
We'll fatten you up before you return to Boston.

			   ROBERT
All right, mama.

			   MARY
All right.
(beaming at him,ADORINGLY:)
Oh Robbie...
