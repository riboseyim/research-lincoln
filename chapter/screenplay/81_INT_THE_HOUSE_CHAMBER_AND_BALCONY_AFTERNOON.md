# INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER AND BALCONY - AFTERNOON

The Clerk continues.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Mr. Walter H. Washburn.

WALTER H. WASHBURN
Votes no.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
And Mr. George Yeaman, how say you?

Yeaman doesn't respond. The silence this causes lengthens,
till representatives begin to look to see what's happened.
Yeaman sits, staring ahead, not responding. Thaddeus Stevens,
sensing something's happening, looks in Yeaman's direction.
Yeaman, still staring ahead, mumbles something, but it's
inaudible.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE (CONT'D)
Sorry Mr. Yeaman, I didn't hear you
			   VOTE -

			   GEORGE YEAMAN
(rising to his feet)
I said aye, Mr. McPherson.
AYE!!!

Great surprise, loud cheers and angry shouts.

			   FERNANDO WOOD
TRAITOR! TRAITOR!

Yeaman looks ready to fa# INT. To the consternation of the
Democrats, a mob of gleeful Republicans rushes across the
aisle that separates the two parties; they surround Yeaman,
shaking his hand, slapping him on the back. Colfax bangs the
gavel.

			   SCHUYLER COLFAX
Order!

Pendleton is speechless. Litton turns to Ashley, both
astonished; Ashley turns to Stevens, who watches, sharp,
observant, giving nothing away.

Mary updates her tally: "8 TO WIN"

SCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D)
Order in the chamber!

Yeaman collapses back into his seat. The room quiets.

SCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D)
Mr. MacPherson, you may proceed.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Mr. Clay R. Hawkins of Ohio.

Hawkins seems to have been startled out of a reverie. Sick
with fear, he looks up at the sound of his name. He can't
speak. Wood and Pendleton watch this, deeply alarmed. Hawkins
snaps out of it.

			   CLAY HAWKINS
Goddamn it, I'm voting yes.
110.

A huge reaction to this. LeClerk gapes at Hawkins.

CLAY HAWKINS (CONT'D)
(right at Pendleton and
Wood!)
I don't care, shoot me dead! You
shoot me dead I, I am voting yes!

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Mr. Edwin F. LeClerk.

LeClerk, seated next to Hawkins and transfixed by his
courage, turns dazedly to McPherson.

			   EDWIN LECLERK
No.
(then, standing abruptly:)
Oh to hell with it, shoot me dead
too. Yes!

The noise gets wilder. Pendleton fixes LeClerk and Hawkins
with a murderous look.

EDWIN LECLERK (CONT'D)
I mean, abstention. Abstention.

Disgust briefly flashing across his face, McPherson crosses
out and changes LeClerk's vote to an abstention. The cheering
and booing degenerates to intense argument about what this
means for the vote count.

In the balcony, Bilbo looks at Hawkins, well-pleased.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Mr. Alexander Coffroth.

Coffroth looks towards Stevens, who doesn't look at him.

			   ALEXANDER COFFROTH
(proud of himself and
happy about the reward
			   HE'LL GET:)
I. Vote. Yes.

Applause. Stevens still doesn't look at Coffroth, but,
tickled, he grins and nods.
