# INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER AND BALCONY - AFTERNOON

Bilbo, pushing past the pages, runs in, holding the note,
Ashley snatches it, reading as he makes his way to the
podium. All eyes are on Ashley.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
From the President:

The chamber falls silent.

JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D)
"So far as I know, there are no
peace commissioners in the city
nor are there likely to be."

Applause, booing, furious discussion.

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
"So far as I know-"?! That means
nothing! Are there commissioners
from the South or aren't there?!

In the balcony, Mary looks to Mrs. Keckley.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
The President has answered you,
sir! Your peace offer is a fiction!

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
That is not a denial, it is a
lawyer's dodge!

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Mr. Haddam? Is your faction
satisfied?
105.

Preston, in the balcony, hesitates. He looks at his daughter,
who gives him a questioning look: "Do you want this on your
head?"

Preston doesn't. He indicates to Haddam with a small shake of
his venerable head: "Drop it."

			   AARON HADDAM
The conservative Republican
faction's satisfied, and we thank
Mr. Lincoln. I move to table Mr.
Wood's motion.

			   SCHUYLER COLFAX
Tabled!

There's an angry response, but Wood and Pendleton sit,
thwarted.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Speaker Colfax, I order the main
question.

			   SCHUYLER COLFAX
A motion has been made to bring the
bill for the Thirteenth Amendment
to a vote. Do I hear a second?

ASA VINTNER LITTON
I second the motion.

			   SCHUYLER COLFAX
So moved, so ordered. The Clerk
will now -
(a rap of the gavel)
Quiet please.

The noise of the chamber and balcony reduce to a rumble.

SCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D)
The clerk will now call the roll
for voting.

Thaddeus Stevens sits silently, tired, concentrated: the
moment has come.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
We begin with Connecticut. Mr.
Augustus Benjamin, on the matter of
this amendment, how say you?

The chamber is completely silent for the first time.
106.

			   AUGUSTUS BENJAMIN
Nay!

The clerk records his vote.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Mr. Arthur Bentleigh.

			   ARTHUR BENTLEIGH
Nay!

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Mr. John Ellis, how say you?

			   JOHN ELLIS
Aye!

Angry shouts from Ellis's fellow Democrats, forcing Colfax to
gavel for order.

			   DEMOCRATIC SENATOR
What?! Shameful!

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Missouri next. Mr. Walter Appleton.

			   WALTER APPLETON
I vote no!

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Mr. Josiah Burton.

JOSIAH BURTON rises to his feet. He is very, very tall and
thin.

			   JOSIAH BURTON
Beanpole Burton is pleased to vote
yea!

Mary watches from the balcony, pleased, but anxious.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
The State of New Jersey. Mr.
Nehemiah Cleary.

			   NEHEMIAH CLEARY
No.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Mr. James Martinson.
107.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Mr. Martinson has delegated me to
say he is indisposed and he
abstains.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Mr. Austin J. Roberts.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Also indisposed, also abstaining.

Shocked anger from the Democrats. Pendleton starts
calculating votes on a sheet of paper. Wood grabs it and
begins to calculate more rapidly.

In the balcony, Mary keeps track on her own list. She writes
carefully next to Roberts's name: "15 TO WIN"

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Illinois concluded. Mr. Harold
Hollister, how say you?

Hollister glowers next to Hutton, who's silently praying.

			   HAROLD HOLLISTER
No.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Mr. Hutton? Mr. William Hutton,
cast your vote.

Hutton looks up from his prayer.

			   WILLIAM HUTTON
William Hutton, remembering at this
moment his beloved brother,
Fredrick, votes against the
amendment.
