# INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Lincoln is seated at the head of the cabinet table along with
Seward. Ashley, Preston and Montgomery Blair. Hay and Nicolay
sit in their usual chairs.

			   PRESTON BLAIR
			   (ANGRY:)
We've managed our members to a fare-
thee-well, you've had no defections
from the Republican right to
trouble you, whereas as to what you
promised - Where the hell are the
commissioners?!

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Oh God...
			   (TO LINCOLN:)
It's true! You, you...lied to me,
Mr. Lincoln! You evaded my requests
for a denial that, that there is a
Confederate peace offer because,
because there is one! We are
absolutely guaranteed to lose the
whole thing -
98.

JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D) MONTGOMERY BLAIR
- and we'll be discredited, We don't need a goddamned
the amendment itself will be abolition amendment! Leave
tainted. What if, what if the Constitution alone! State
these peace commissioners by state you can extirpate -
appear today? Or worse, on
the morning -

			   LINCOLN
I can't listen to this anymore! I
can't accomplish a goddamned thing
of any human meaning or worth until
we cure ourselves of slavery and
end this pestilential war, and
whether any of you or anyone else
knows it, I know I need this! This
amendment is that cure! We're
stepped out upon the world's stage
now, now, with the fate of human
dignity in our hands! Blood's been
spilt to afford us this moment!

He points around the table at Ashley, Monty, Preston.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
Now now now! And you grousle and
heckle and dodge about like
pettifogging Tammany Hall
hucksters! See what is before you!
See the here and now! That's the
hardest thing, the only thing that
accounts! Abolishing slavery by
constitutional provision settles
the fate, for all coming time, not
only of the millions now in bondage
but of unborn millions to come. Two
votes stand in its way, and these
votes must be procured.

			   SEWARD
We need two yeses, three
abstentions, or four yeses and one
more abstention and the amendment
will pass -

			   LINCOLN
You got a night and a day and a
night and several perfectly good
hours! Now get the hell out of here
and get \`em!

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Yes but how?
99.

			   LINCOLN
Buzzards' guts, man.

Lincoln rises, and keeps rising, till he seems eight feet
tall.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
I am the President of the United
States of America, clothed in
immense power! You will procure me
these votes.
