### TITLE: US ARMY HEADQUARTERS

### CITY POINT, VIRGINIA

###			   JANUARY 12

# INT. LINCOLN'S BEDROOM, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Tad, in fancy military uniform, sits on the bed, Gardener's
box of glass negatives open beside him. He holds up a plate
to a lamp:

An old black man with a thick beard and hair, shirtless.

Tad looks at another plate:

A young black woman, headscarf, huge ugly scar across her
cheek and down her neck.

He studies these with solemn concentration.

ROBERT (O.C.)
You drafted half the men in Boston!
What do you think their families
think about me?

Lincoln is being dressed in formal wear by his valet, WILLIAM
SLADE, a light-skinned black man in his 40s. Robert, already
in his morning suit, is standing by the door.

			   ROBERT (CONT'D)
The only reason they don't throw
things and spit on me is \`cause
you're so popular. I can't
concentrate on, on British
mercantile law, I don't care about
British mercantile law. I might not
even want to be a lawyer -

			   LINCOLN
It's a sturdy profession, and a
useful one.

			   ROBERT
Yes, and I want to be useful, but
now, not afterwards!

Slade hands Lincoln his formal gloves.

			   LINCOLN
I ain't wearing them things, Mr.
Slade, they never fit right.

			   WILLIAM SLADE
The missus will have you wear \`em.
Don't think about leaving \`em.

			   ROBERT
You're delaying, that's your
favorite tactic.

WILLIAM SLADE ROBERT
(to Robert:) You won't tell me no, but the
Be useful and stop war will be over in a month,
distracting him. and you know it will!

			   LINCOLN
			   (TO ROBERT:)
I've found that prophesying is one
of life's less prophet-able
occupations!

He accepts the gloves. Slade laughs a little, Robert scowls.
Tad holds another glass negative up to the light.

			   TAD
Why do some slaves cost more than
others?
52.

			   ROBERT
If they're still young and healthy,
if the women can still conceive,
they'll pay more -

			   LINCOLN
Put \`em back in the box. We'll
return them to Mr. Gardner's studio
day after next. Be careful with
\`em, now.
(tugging at his gloves:)
These things should've stayed on
the calf.

			   TAD
(to Slade, putting the
			   PLATES AWAY:)
When you were a slave, Mr. Slade,
did they beat you?

			   WILLIAM SLADE
I was born a free man. Nobody beat
me except I beat them right back.

There's a knock on the door and Mrs. Keckley enters.

			   ELIZABETH KECKLEY
Mr. Lincoln, could you come with me-

			   WILLIAM SLADE
			   (TO TAD:)
Mrs. Keckley was a slave. Ask her
if she was beaten.

			   TAD LINCOLN
Were you - (shakes his head)
Tad.

			   ELIZABETH KECKLEY
			   (TO TAD:)
I was beaten with a fire shovel
when I was younger than you.
			   (TO LINCOLN:)
You should go to Mrs. Lincoln.
She's in Willie's room.

			   ROBERT
She never goes in there.

Lincoln starts towards the door just as John Hay enters,
dressed in the uniform of a Brevet Colonel.
53.

			   JOHN HAY
The reception line is already
stretching out the door.

Robert shoots an angry, envious glance at Hay's uniform as
Lincoln, Slade, Mrs. Keckley and Hay leave. Robert calls to
			  HIS FATHER:

			   ROBERT
I'll be the only man over fifteen
and under sixty-five in this whole
place not in uniform.

			   TAD
I'm under fifteen and I have a
uniform.

Robert storms out.
