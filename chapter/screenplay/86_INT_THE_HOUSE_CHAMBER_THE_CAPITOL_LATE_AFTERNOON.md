# INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER, THE CAPITOL - LATE AFTERNOON

Representatives throw papers in the air, embrace, weep,
shout, dance, climb on desks. In the balcony, Mary stands
slowly, beyond tears or joy; Mrs. Keckley stands with her,
smiling, crying. Preston Blair applauds vigorously. The black
visitors join the general exultation, overwhelmed, some
praying, others embracing and weeping.

Latham's, Schell's and Bilbo's seats are empty; they've gone.

Ashley, grinning from ear to ear, tears streaming down his
face, is hoisted up on shoulders and marched around the room,
as on the floor and in the balcony, people start singing "The
Battle Cry of Freedom."

Pendleton, with the face of someone who's seen his world
collapse into ruin, walks straight at Yeaman, who's listening
to the singing, deeply moved, his face full of wonder.
Pendleton turns, without a word, and leaves the House.
114.

Yeaman laughs, and loudly joins in singing.

Stevens clumps over to the Clerk of the House, who is placing
his tallies and the official copy of the amendment bill in a
folio. He looks up.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
Congratulations, Mr. Chairman.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
The bill, Mr. McPherson, may I...?

The Clerk hands the bill to Stevens, who folds it and pockets it.

THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
That's...That's the official bill.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
I'll return it in the morning.Creased, but unharmed.
