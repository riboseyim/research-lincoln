# INT. A CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE HOUSE CHAMBER - LATER

Stevens sits on a bench, alone, thinking, troubled. Asa
Vintner Litton approaches him.

ASA VINTNER LITTON
You asked if ever I was surprised.

Stevens nods.

ASA VINTNER LITTON (CONT'D)
Today, Mr. Stevens, I was surprised. You've led the battle
for race equality for thirty years! The basis of, of every hope for
this country's future life, you denied Negro equality! I'm
nauseated. You refused to say that all humans are, well... human! Have
you lost your very soul, Mr.Stevens? Is there nothing you won't say?

Stevens nods, then, quietly:

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
I'm sorry you're nauseous, Asa,that must be unpleasant. I want the amendment to pass. So that the Constitution's first and only mention of slavery is its absolute prohibition. For this amendment, for which I have worked all of my life and for which countless colored men and women have fought and died and now hundreds of thousands of soldiers - no, sir, no, it seems there is very
nearly nothing I won't say.
