# EXT. THE JAMES RIVER DOCK AT CITY POINT, VIRGINIA - DAY

As a somber Grant disembarks with his aides from the River QUEEN:

GRANT (V.O.)
"Office United States Military Telegraph, War Dept. For Abraham
Lincoln, President of the United States. January 20, 1865. I will state confidentially that I am convinced, upon conversation with
these Commissioners, that their intentions are good and their desire sincere to restore peace and union. I fear now their going back,
without any expression of interest..."

Seward's voice takes over from Grant's.

GRANT (V.O.) (CONT'D) SEWARD (V.O.)
"...from anyone in authority, "...from anyone in authority, Mr. Lincoln..." Mr. Lincoln..."
