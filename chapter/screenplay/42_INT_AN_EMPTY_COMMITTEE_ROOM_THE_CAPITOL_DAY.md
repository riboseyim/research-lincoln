# INT. AN EMPTY COMMITTEE ROOM, THE CAPITOL - DAY

Hawkins enters and stops when he sees Pendleton and Wood.
It's a trap. LeClerk follows, closing the door.

			   FERNANDO WOOD
Bless my eyes, if it isn't the Post
Master of Millersburg Ohio!

Hawkins looks at LeClerk, who guiltily avoids his glance.

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound to
inform us. Of your disgusting
betrayal. Your prostitution.

			   FERNANDO WOOD
Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins?
Is your maidenly virtue for sale?

Hawkins sinks.
