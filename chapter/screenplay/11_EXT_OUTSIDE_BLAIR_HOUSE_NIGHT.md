# EXT. OUTSIDE BLAIR HOUSE - NIGHT

A light snow's beginning to fall. A lacquered coach stands
outside the house, the Blair crest in gold on its doors.

Elizabeth Blair Lee, a blanket in her arms, comes out of the
house, talking to LEO, an elderly black servant, formerly a
slave belonging to the Blairs. They're followed by an elderly
black woman in a housekeeper's uniform.

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
Leo, it's a hundred miles to
Richmond. Get him drunk so he can
sleep.

			   LEO
Yes'm.

Elizabeth goes to the carriage, where Preston awaits. She
passes the blanket through the carriage window and tucks it
around her father.

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
Here, daddy.
23.

PRESTON BLAIR ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
Oh! Thank you. (fussing with the
			   BLANKET:)
Let's fix this up...

			   PRESTON BLAIR
Where's my hat?

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
Leo has your hat. All right?

As Leo climbs into the carriage, Elizabeth kisses her hand,
then slaps the kiss on her father's cheek.

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D)
Go make peace.
