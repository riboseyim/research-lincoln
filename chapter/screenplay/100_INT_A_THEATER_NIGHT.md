# INT. A THEATER - NIGHT

The theater is adorned with patriotic bunting.

Onstage, a Caliph's palace. A YOUNG MAN duels with scimitars
against a huge, hideous AFRIT. A YOUNG WOMAN in chains cowers
in distress. The young man gymnastically avoids being killed,
then plunges his scimitar into the afrit's heart. The demon
screams and topples to the ground. The audience gasps as a
124.

flame-colored, bejewelled bird rises up from the dead afrit's
heart.

The audience applauds. In the center box, Tad Lincoln is
joining in, as is his companion for the evening, Tom Pendel.

Onstage, the bird flies off, the young man is freeing the
young woman, when the scene is halted by the red curtain
lowering, surprising actors and audience. The music dies,
the gas lights in the house are being raised as the owner of
the theater, LEONARD GROVER, steps out before the curtain and
walks to the center of the stage, pale and badly shaken.

In the box, Tom Pendel glances quickly at Tad, who's fixed on
the stage, eyes open, alarmed.

The audience knows something's wrong. Their rising murmur of
concern dies immediately when Grover raises his hands.

			   LEONARD GROVER
			   (VOICE SHAKING:)
The President has been shot.

There are screams of horror from the audience; people leap
from their seats.

LEONARD GROVER (CONT'D)
The President has been shot at
Ford's Theater!

The theater is a scene of complete pandemonium. People cry,
jam the aisles, call to each other across rows of seats,
shout questions at Grover, who's calling for calm, inaudible
in the uproar.

Tom Pendel is frozen in shock, then turns to draw Tad close
to him. Tad pulls away and begins shrieking, clinging to the
railing so tightly that Pendel can't pry him loose. Tad can't
stop screaming, his eyes wide open, seeing nothing.
