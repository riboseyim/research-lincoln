# INT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

Spectacles on, Lincoln unlaces Mary's corset.

			   LINCOLN
Robert's going to plead with us to
let him enlist.

He's unlaced enough; she unhooks the front and steps out of
her corset and petticoats, turns to him in her plain thin
chemise and drawers.

			   MARY
Make time to talk to Robbie. You
only have time for Tad.

			   LINCOLN
Tad's young.

			   MARY
So's Robert. Too young for the
army.

			   LINCOLN
Plenty of boys younger than Robert
signing up...

			   MARY
Don't take Robbie. Don't let me
lose my son.

There's a knock on the door. Mary turns to it, furious:

			   MARY (CONT'D)
Go away! We're occupied!

Lincoln opens the door. Nicolay's standing there.

			   JOHN NICOLAY
Secretary Stanton has sent over to
tell you that as of half an hour
ago, the shelling of Wilmington
harbor has commenced.
61.

Lincoln leaves with Nicolay. Mary watches, frozen, unable to
let him go, knowing she can't stop him.
