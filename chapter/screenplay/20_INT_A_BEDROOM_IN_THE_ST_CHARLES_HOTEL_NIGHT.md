# INT. A BEDROOM IN THE ST. CHARLES HOTEL - NIGHT

A small room, two beds, in disarray: newspapers, overflowing
ashtrays, whiskey bottles empty on the floor. Latham and
Schell stand at a table strewn with the remnants of a poker
game. Bilbo lies on one of the beds. All three are in their
shirtsleeves. Seward is at the table.
43.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
- so the total of representatives
voting three weeks from today is
reduced to 182, which means 122 yes
votes to reach the requisite two-
thirds of the House. Assuming all
Republicans vote for the
amendment...?

Seward nods, less assertively than Latham would like.

ROBERT LATHAM (CONT'D)
Then, despite our abstention, to
reach a two-thirds majority we
remain 20 yeses short.
