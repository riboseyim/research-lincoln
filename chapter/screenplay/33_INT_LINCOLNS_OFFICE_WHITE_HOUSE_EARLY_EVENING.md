# INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

Seward stands, stunned. Lincoln sits at the cabinet table.
Nicolay is gone.

			   SEWARD
Why wasn't I consulted?! I'm Secretary of State! You, you, you
informally send a reactionary dottard, to - What will happen, do
you imagine, when these peace commissioners arrive?

			   LINCOLN
We'll hear \`em out.

			   SEWARD
Oh, splendid! And next the Democrats will invite \`em up to
hearings on the Hill, and the newspapers - well, the newspapers -
the newspapers will ask "why risk enraging the Confederacy over the
issue of slavery when they're here to make peace?" We'll lose every
Democrat we've got, more than likely conservative Republicans
will join \`em, and all our work, all our preparing the ground for
the vote, laid waste, for naught.

			   LINCOLN
The Blairs have promised support for the amendment if we listen to
these people -

			   SEWARD
Oh, the Blairs promise, do they? You think they'll keep their
promise once we have heard these delegates and refused them? Which
we will have to do, since their proposal most certainly will be
predicated on keeping their slaves!

			   LINCOLN
What hope for any Democratic votes, Willum, if word gets out that I've refused a chance to end the war? You think word won't get out? In Washington?

			   SEWARD
It's either the amendment or this Confederate peace, you cannot have both.

			   LINCOLN
"If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me..."

			   SEWARD
Oh, disaster. This is a disaster!

			   LINCOLN
Time is a great thickener of things, Willum.

			   SEWARD
Yes, I suppose it is - Actually I have no idea what you mean by that.

Lincoln stands.

			   LINCOLN
Get me thirteen votes.(in a thick Kentucky  ACCENT:)
Them fellers from Richmond ain't here yit.
