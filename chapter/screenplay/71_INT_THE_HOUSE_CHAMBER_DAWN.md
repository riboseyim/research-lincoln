# INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - DAWN

The chamber is quiet and dark. Pages and clerks prepare the
desks, laying out pens and paper, filling inkwells.

TITLE: THE MORNING OF THE VOTE

JANUARY 31, 1865

A CLERK is draping red-white-and-blue bunting on the desks of
representatives from seceded states. These will of course
remain unoccupied during the vote.

The first Congressman to arrive, Thaddeus Stevens clumps in.
He goes to his desk and sits. He looks around the empty
chamber, ready and waiting.
