# EXT. OUTSIDE THE ARMY HOSPITAL - MORNING

Robert, brooding, waits in the buggy.

Hearing a creaking, rumbling sound, Robert turns to see TWO
BLACK ORDERLIES in grey uniforms wrangling a large top-heavy
wheelbarrow, covered with filthy canvas. One orderly pushes
while the other keeps the barrow from tipping over.

Robert notices, in the barrow's wake, a trail of blood. He
gets out of the buggy and follows as the orderlies turn a
corner of the building.

Behind the building, where the ground is bare, pitted with
puddles of water, Robert watches as the orderlies reach the
edge of a shallow pit. One orderly pulls the canvas back,
revealing severed legs, arms, hands, rotten, burnt, shattered
by bullet or bomb.

Robert watches as they toss the remains into the pit.
Quicklime is shoveled atop the limbs.

Robert walks away, unsteady.

Around the corner, he fumbles through his pockets for rolling
paper and tobacco. He locates these and tries to focus on
rolling a cigarette, his hands shaking. He tries harder to
control his hands, his feelings, but he can't. He has a panic
attack, crying, hiccupy shallow breathing, face flushed.
Frustrated, he throws down the cigarette and tries to hold
back tears.

LINCOLN (O.C.)
What's the matter, Bob?

Robert looks up, mortified, to see Lincoln watching him with
concern. He wipes his eyes, his mouth.

			   ROBERT
I have to do this! And I will do it
and I don't need your permission to
enlist.

			   LINCOLN
That same speech has been made by
how many sons to how many fathers
since the war began? "I don't need
your damn permission, you miserable
old goat, I'm gonna enlist anyhow!"
And what wouldn't those numberless
fathers have given to be able to
say to their sons - as I now say to
mine - "I'm commander-in-chief, so
in point of fact, without my
permission, you ain't enlisting in
nothing, nowhere, young man."
84.

			   ROBERT
It's mama you're scared of, not me
getting killed.

Lincoln slaps Robert in the face. It shocks them both.

Lincoln tries to embrace Robert, but Robert shoulders past
him and walks back toward the front of he building. He turns.

			   ROBERT (CONT'D)
I have to do this! And I will! Or I
will feel ashamed of myself for the
rest of my life. Whether or not you
fought is what's gonna matter. And
not just to other people, but to
myself.
I won't be you, pa. I can't do
that. But I don't want to be
nothing.

He hurries away.

			   LINCOLN
We can't lose you.
