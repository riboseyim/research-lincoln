# EXT. IN AN OPEN FIELD NEAR PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA - EVENING

THREE UNION CAVALRY OFFICERS consult with THREE CONFEDERATE
CAVALRY OFFICERS, all mounted. The officers exchange
documents and salutes.

### TITLE: NO MAN'S LAND

### OUTSIDE PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA

###			   JANUARY 11

The ranking Confederate trots to a buggy in which three
Confederate officials sit: Vice President ALEXANDER STEPHENS,
53, short; JOHN A. CAMPBELL, Assistant Secretary of War, 54;
and Senator R.M.T. HUNTER, 56. They're well-dressed for
winter, Stephens especially heavily bundled.

Stephens, Campbell and the indignant Hunter leave the buggy
and are escorted by Confederate officers to the waiting
company of Union cavalry and infantry.

A Union Army ambulance, a large American flag painted on one
side, driven by TWO BLACK SOLDIERS, stands near broken wagons
and a derelict cannon. ANOTHER BLACK SOLDIER stands at
attention by the ambulance's rear door.

The soldier, staring coldly at these men, gestures brusquely
to the ambulance. The Confederate peace commissioners
hesitate; Hunter stares in horror at the black soldiers. Then
Stephens pushes past Hunter. He nods to the soldier.

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
(with polite dignity:)
Much obliged.

He boards the ambulance. His fellow delegates follow in his
wake, Hunter glaring with defiant hatred at the soldiers
before climbing in.
