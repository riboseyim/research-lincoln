# INT. FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - DAY

A gavel slams down on a sounding block in an attempt to
silence the raucous tumult in the large chamber. It subsides
enough for Colfax to be heard from his chair atop the central
			  DAIS:

			   SCHUYLER COLFAX
The House recognizes Fernando Wood,
the honorable representative from
New York.

TITLE: THE HOUSE DEBATE BEGINS

			   JANUARY 9

Floor and balcony are full, although the desks of
representatives from seceded states are bare and unoccupied.

On the Democratic side, 81 members applaud FERNANDO WOOD (D,
NY) as he takes the podium. The Democratic leadership,
including GEORGE YEAMAN (KY), has gathered around House
minority leader GEORGE PENDLETON(OH). On the Republican side
of the aisle, enraged booing from the 102 Republicans,
including HIRAM PRICE (IA), GEORGE JULIAN (IN), Vintner
Litton and Ashley, all gathered around Stevens's desk.

			   FERNANDO WOOD
Estimable colleagues. Two bloody
years ago this month, his Highness,
King Abraham Africanus the First -
our Great Usurping Caesar, violator
of habeas corpus and freedom of the
press, abuser of states' rights -

HIRAM PRICE FERNANDO WOOD
(loud:) - radical republican autocrat
If Lincoln really were a ruling by fiat and martial
tyrant, Mr. Wood, he'd'a had law affixed his name to his
your empty head impaled on a heinous and illicit
pike, and the country better Emancipation Proclamation,
for it! promising it would hasten the
end of the war, which yet
rages on and on.

Murmuring from the floor and the balcony, in the front row of
which Mary and Elizabeth Keckley sit. Mary turns her gaze
from the floor to watch Latham and Schell, a few seats away,
scrutinize the floor, whispering, Latham taking notes. Schell
holds the leather prospectus folio in his lap. Bilbo sits
behind them.

They study the other NY Democrats - CHARLES HANSON, NELSON
MERRICK, HENRY LANFORD, HOMER BENSON, GILES STUART - who

comprise a cluster of glum uncomfortable passivity on that
side of the aisle.

army into the unwilling
instrument of his monarchical
			  AMBITIONS -

Wood points at Stevens, granite-faced. Stevens's eyes burn
back at Wood.

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)
- and radical Republicanism's
abolitionist fanaticism!

This prompts shouts and boos from the Republicans.

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)
His Emancipation Proclamation has
obliterated millions of dollars'
worth of personal property rights -

Schell examines the Pennsylvania Democrats: an openly
appalled ARCHIBALD MORAN, AMBROSE BAILER, and, chewing his
thumb, a painful fake grin pinned to his face, ALEXANDER
COFFROTH. Schell leans in to Latham.

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) RICHARD SCHELL

hopelessly indolent Negro thumb?

cities!
			   RICHARD SCHELL
Perhaps he'll jump.

Cheering and booing.

In the Connecticut delegation, JOHN ELLIS winds his pocket
watch, looking contemptuously at Wood. Schell makes a note.

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) W.N. BILBO
But all that was not enough Jesus, when's this son-of-
for this dictator, who now liberty sonofabitch gonna sit
seeks to insinuate his down?
miscegenist pollution into
the Constitution itself! RICHARD SCHELL
John Ellis is going to break
his watch if he doesn't stop -

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)
We are once again asked - nay,
commanded - to consider a proposed
thirteenth amendment which, if
passed, shall set at immediate
liberty four million coloreds while
manacling the limbs of the white
race in America. If it is passed -
but it shall not pass!

Wild cheering and booing.

FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) ROBERT LATHAM
Every member of the House What's more interesting is
loyal to the Democratic Party how dismal and disgruntled
and the constituents it Mr. Yeaman appears. He should
serves shall oppose- be cheering right now, but...

W.N. BILBO
Looks like he ate a bad
oyster.

Thaddeus Stevens calls out from his desk.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
A point of order, Mr. Speaker, if
you please? When will Mr. Wood -

			   FERNANDO WOOD
Mr. Speaker, I still have the floor
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania
is out of order!

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
- when will Mr. Wood conclude his
interminable gabble? Some of us
breathe oxygen, and we find the
mephitic fumes of his oratory a
lethal challenge to our pleural
capacities.

Wild cheering, applause from the Republicans.
37.

			   FERNANDO WOOD
We shall oppose this amendment, and
any legislation that so affronts
natural law, insulting to God as to
man! Congress must never declare
equal those whom God created
unequal!

The Democrats cheer. Mary watches with concern. Mrs. Keckley
is angry and uncomfortable.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
Slavery is the only insult to
natural law, you fatuous
nincompoop!

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
Order! Procedure! Mr. Speaker, Mr.
Wood has the floor!
			   (TO STEVENS:)
Instruct us, Oh Great Commoner,
what is unnatural, in your opinion?
Niggrahs casting ballots? Niggrah
representatives? Is that natural,
Stevens? Intermarriage?

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
What violates natural law? Slavery,
and you, Pendleton, you insult God,
you unnatural noise.

An avalanche of boos and cheers as Democrats surge towards
Wood, Republicans towards Stevens. Ashley rushes to Colfax,
			  CALLING:

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Mr. Colfax! Please, use your gavel!
They are -
(to the Democrats:)
You are out of order!
			   (TO COLFAX:)
Direct the sergeant of arms to
suppress this!
(back to the Democrats:)
We are in session!
