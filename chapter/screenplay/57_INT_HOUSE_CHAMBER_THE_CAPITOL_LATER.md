# INT. HOUSE CHAMBER, THE CAPITOL - LATER

Stevens, at the podium, is being challenged by Fernando Wood, standing at his desk.

			   FERNANDO WOOD
I've asked you a question, Mr.Stevens, and you must answer me. Do you or do you not hold that the precept that "all men are created equal" is meant literally?

All eyes are on Stevens, the chamber quiet except for a scratching sound: the journalists have begun scribbling.

			   FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)
Is that not the true purpose of the amendment? To promote your ultimate and ardent dream to elevate -

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
The true purpose of the amendment,Mr. Wood, you perfectly-named, brainless, obstructive object?

			   FERNANDO WOOD
You have always insisted, Mr.Stevens, that Negroes are the same as white men are.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
The true purpose of the amendment -

Stevens looks up at the balcony, at the waiting journalists, and Mary, who raises her eyebrows, then at Ashley and Litton at their desks. Seward watches from the balcony.

Stevens returns to Wood.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)
I don't hold with equality in all things only with equality before the law and nothing more.

			   FERNANDO WOOD(SURPRISED:)
That's not so! You believe that Negroes are entirely equal to white men. You've said it a thousand  TIMES -

			   GEORGE PENDLETON(leaping to his feet)
For shame! For shame! Stop prevaricating and answer Representative Wood!

			   THADDEUS STEVENS GEORGE PENDLETON
I don't hold with equality in (stands:) all things, only with After the decades of fervent
equality before the law and advocacy on behalf of the nothing more. colored race -

			   JAMES ASHLEY(LEAPING UP:)
He's answered your questions! This amendment has naught to do with race equality!

Pendleton persists, through cheers and catcalls.

			   GEORGE PENDLETON THADDEUS STEVENS
You have long insisted, have I don't hold with equality in you not, that the dusk- all things only with equality colored race is no different before the law and nothing from the white one. more.

Among the amendment's supporters, including Vintner Litton, a GROUP OF WOMEN SUFFRAGISTS in the balcony, and Elizabeth Keckley, there's visible, audible shock and dismay at Stevens's capitulation. Mary's surprised by Stevens, and impressed.

			   MARY(whispering to Mrs. KECKLEY :)
Who'd ever've guessed that old nightmare capable of such control?
He might make a politician someday -

			   ELIZABETH KECKLEY (STANDING ABRUPTLY:)
I need to go.

Mary's startled. Mrs. Keckley leaves the balcony, pushing past journalists. On the floor:

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
Your frantic attempt to delude us now is unworthy of a representative. It is, in fact,unworthy of a white man!

			   THADDEUS STEVENS(giving in to his anger:)
How can I hold that all men are created equal, when here before me - (pointing to Pendleton:) - stands stinking the moral carcass of the gentleman from Ohio, proof that some men are inferior, endowed by their Maker with dim wits impermeable to reason with cold pallid slime in their veins instead of hot red blood! You are more reptile than man, George, so low and flat that the foot of man is incapable of crushing you!

General uproar.

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
HOW DARE YOU!

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
Yet even you, Pendleton, who should have been gibbetted for treason long before today, even worthless unworthy you ought to be treated equally before the law! And so again, sir, and again and again and again I say: **I DO NOT HOLD WITH EQUALITY IN ALL THINGS. ONLY WITH EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.**

Ashley sits, nearly weeping with relief, while the chamber explodes: laughter, applause, boos.

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
MR. SPEAKER, WILL YOU PERMIT THIS VILE BOORISH MAN TO SLANDER AND TO THREATEN ME AND -

The journalists pack up their notebooks; this is fun, but not newsworthy, and only a few bother to record it.

Stevens limps out through the aisle to wild Republican applause. He looks up to the balcony; Mary is looking down approvingly. He looks down before she can see him smile.
