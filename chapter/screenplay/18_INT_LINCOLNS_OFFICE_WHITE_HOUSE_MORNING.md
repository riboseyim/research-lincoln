# INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

Preston Blair, still in his traveling cloak, and Lincoln
stand near the fireplace facing one another.

			   PRESTON BLAIR
Jefferson Davis is sending three
delegates: Stephens, Hunter and
Campbell: Vice President of the
Confederacy, their former Secretary
of State, and their Assistant
41.

Secretary of War. They're coming in
earnest to propose peace.

Both men look into the fire. Preston moves closer.

PRESTON BLAIR (CONT'D)
I know this is unwelcome news for
you. Now hear me: I went to
Richmond to talk to traitors, to
smile at and plead with traitors,
because it'll be spring in two
months, the roads'll be passable,
the Spring slaughter commences.
Four bloody Springs now! Think of
my Frank, who you've taken to your
heart, how you'll blame yourself if
the war takes my son as it's taken
multitudes of sons. Think of all
the boys who'll die if you don't
make peace. You must talk with
these men!

			   LINCOLN
I intend to, Preston. And in
return, I must ask you -

PRESTON BLAIR LINCOLN
No, this is not horsetrading, - to support our push for
this is life and - the amendment when it reaches
			   THE -

There's a knock on the door.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
Not now!

Robert enters. Nicolay stands behind him, apologetic.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
Oh. Bob. I'm sorry. Welcome home.

He shakes hands with his son, stiffly.

			   ROBERT
Thank you.

LINCOLN PRESTON BLAIR
(to Robert:) (pointedly:)
I'm talking to Preston Blair, You're looking fit, Robert.
we - Harvard agrees with you. Fit
ROBERT and rested.
Mr. Blair.
42.

			   LINCOLN
(dismissing Robert,
			   UNINTENTIONALLY ABRUPT)
Just give us a moment please,
Robert. Thank you.

He turns to Preston. Robert, stung, hesitates, then leaves
the room, Nicolay shutting the door behind him.

			   PRESTON BLAIR
I will procure your votes for you,
as I promised. You've always kept
your word to me. Those Southern men
are coming.
(taking Lincoln's hand)
I beg you, in the name of Gentle
			   CHRIST -

PRESTON BLAIR (CONT'D) LINCOLN
Talk peace with these men. Preston, I understand...

			   LINCOLN
			   (SHARPLY)
I understand, Preston.
