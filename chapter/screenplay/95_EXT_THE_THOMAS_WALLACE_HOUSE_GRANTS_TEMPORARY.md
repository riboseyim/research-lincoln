# EXT. THE THOMAS WALLACE HOUSE, GRANT'S TEMPORARY
HEADQUARTERS, ON MARKET STREET, PETERSBURG - MORNING

Grant, smoking his cigar, his uniform dusty and rumpled, is
sitting on the small porch. He stares piercingly at Lincoln,
in a rocker next to him, watching his troops pass by as they
move in to secure the conquered town. Lincoln closes his
eyes.

He has grown older, the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed
with fine creases, and his hair's thinner, softer, suffused
with grey. His brow has grown smoother.

			   LINCOLN
Once he surrenders, send his boys
back to their homes, their farms,
their shops.

			   GRANT
Yes sir, as we discussed.

			   LINCOLN
Liberality all around. No
punishment. I don't want that. And
the leaders - Jeff and the rest of
\`em - if they escape, leave the
country while my back's turned,
that wouldn't upset me none.

When peace comes it mustn't just be
hangings.

			   GRANT
By outward appearance, you're ten
years older than you were a year
ago.

			   LINCOLN
Some weariness has bit at my bones.
			   (BEAT)
I never seen the like of it before.
What I seen today. Never seen the
like of it before.

			   GRANT
You always knew that, what this was
going to be. Intimate, and ugly.
You must've needed to see it close
when you decided to come down here.

			   LINCOLN
We've made it possible for one
another to do terrible things.

			   GRANT
And we've won the war. Now you have
to lead us out of it.
