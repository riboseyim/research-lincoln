# EXT. A WOODS ALONG THE POTOMAC RIVER - MORNING

Bilbo and Clay Hawkins are again in the woods. Bilbo, with
his basket, clutches a pair of noisy snared partridges.

			   CLAY HAWKINS
My neighbors hear that I voted yes
for nigger freedom and no to peace,
they will kill me.

W.N. BILBO
A deal's a deal and you men know
better than to piss your pants just
cause there's talk about peace
talks.

W.N. BILBO (CONT'D) CLAY HAWKINS
My neighbors in Nashville, Look, I'll find another job.
they found out I was loyal to
the Union, they came after me
with gelding knives!

Hawkins runs away from Bilbo. Bilbo chases him.
CLAY HAWKINS W.N. BILBO

			   CLAY HAWKINS
(turning back to Bilbo:)
I want to do right! But I got no
courage!!!

Hawkins runs away, sobbing. Bilbo pursues.

W.N. BILBO
Wait!! You wanted, what was it, tax
man for the Western Reserve, hell

Ohio if you -

Bilbo stops, winded.

W.N. BILBO (CONT'D)
