# INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Lincoln sits before an open window. He's dishevelled, in
shirtsleeves an unbuttoned vest, next to an inkwell, papers
and books of law scattered about, and a lit candle in a
candlestick, guttering. Grant's telegraph is in one hand, and
in the other hand, his spectacles and, dangling from a chain,
his open pocket watch. His bare left foot keeps time with the
watch's loud ticking. He stares out into the cold night.
