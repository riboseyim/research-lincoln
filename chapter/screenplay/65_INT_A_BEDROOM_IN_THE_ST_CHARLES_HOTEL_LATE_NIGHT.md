# INT. A BEDROOM IN THE ST. CHARLES HOTEL - LATE NIGHT

The room is far filthier and more cluttered than before.
Bilbo and Latham are playing cards. Schell is asleep in bed.

W.N. BILBO
My whole hand's gonna be proud in
about five seconds, let's see how
proud you gonna be.
89.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
Oh, it is? What you got goin'?

There's a quick knock on the door.

W.N. BILBO
Yeah?

			   ROBERT LATHAM
Go away!
			   (TO BILBO)
That watch fob, is that gold?

W.N. BILBO
You keep your eyes off my fob!

Seward enters, displeased, as they show their cards,
laughing.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
Nines paired!

W.N. BILBO
Oh my God damn!

			   SEWARD
Gentlemen. You have a visitor.

Latham jovially collects his winnings. He stops short when
Lincoln steps into the room, cloak and stovepipe, very tall.

W.N. BILBO
Well, I'll be fucked.

			   LINCOLN
I wouldn't bet against it, Mr...?

Schell startles awake as Bilbo puts down his cigar and wipes
his hand on his vest.

W.N. BILBO
W.N. Bilbo.

			   LINCOLN
Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
Sir...

W.N. BILBO
Why are you here? No offense, but
Mr. Seward's banished the very
mention of your name, he won't even


let us use fifty-cent pieces \`cause they got your face on \`em.

			   LINCOLN
The Secretary of State here tells
me that, uh, you got eleven
Democrats in the bag. That's
encouraging.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
Oh, you've got no cause to be
encouraged. Sir. Uh...

			   RICHARD SCHELL
Are we being...fired?

Lincoln sits at the card table.

			   LINCOLN
"We have heard the chimes of
midnight, Master Shallow." I'm here
to alert you boys that the great
day of reckoning is nigh upon us.

			   RICHARD SCHELL
The Democrats we've yet to bag,
sir. The patronage jobs simply
won't bag \`em. They require
more...convincing, Mr. President.

Lincoln nods. He turns to Bilbo.

			   LINCOLN
Mm-hmm. Do me a favor, willya?

W.N. BILBO
Sure.

			   LINCOLN
Snagged my eye in the paper this
morning. Governor Curtin is set to
declare a winner in the disputed
Congressional election for the -

W.N. BILBO
Pennsylvania 16th District.

			   LINCOLN
What a joy to be comprehended. Hop
on a train to Philadell, call on
the Governor -
91.

			   SEWARD
(looking askance at
			   BILBO'S APPEARANCE:)
Send Latham. Or Schell.

			   LINCOLN
			   (TO BILBO:)
No, he'll do fine, just polish
yourself up first.

Bilbo, cigar back in mouth, laughs.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
The incumbent is claiming he won
it. Name of, uh...

W.N. BILBO
Coffroth.

			   LINCOLN
That's him.

			   RICHARD SCHELL
Coffroth. He is a Democrat.

LINCOLN W.N. BILBO
I understand he is. Silly name.
Let Governor Curtin know it'd
be much appreciated if he'd
invite the House of
Representatives to decide who
won. He's entitled to do
that. He'll agree to it.
			   (TO SCHELL:)
Then advise Coffroth, if he
hopes to retain his seat,
that he'd better pay a visit
to Thaddeus Stevens.

			   SEWARD
Pity poor Coffroth.
