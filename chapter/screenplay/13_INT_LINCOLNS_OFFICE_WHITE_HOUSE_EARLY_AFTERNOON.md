# INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - EARLY AFTERNOON

Nicolay opens the door to the crowded outer office to admit
perpetually worried JAMES ASHLEY, 42, (R, OH). Tad eyes him
from a chair by the window.
29.

Lincoln enters the room with Seward.

			   LINCOLN
Well, Mr. Representative Ashley!
Tell us the news from the Hill.

Lincoln shakes his hand and warmly claps the discombobulated
but flattered representative on the shoulder.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Well! Ah! News -

			   LINCOLN
Why for instance is this thus, and
what is the reason for this
thusness?

			   JAMES ASHLEY
I...

			   SEWARD
James, we want you to bring the
anti-slavery amendment to the floor
for debate -

JAMES ASHLEY SEWARD
Excuse me. What? - immediately, and - You are
the amendment's manager, are
you not?

			   JAMES ASHLEY
I am, of course - But -
Immediately?

			   SEWARD
And we're counting on robust radical support, so tell Mr. Stevens we expect him to put his
back into it, it's not going to be easy, but we trust -

			   JAMES ASHLEY
It's impossible. No, I am sorry,no, we can't organize anything immediately in the House. I have been canvassing the Democrats since
the election, in case any of them softened after they got walloped.
But they have stiffened if anything, Mr. Secretary. There
aren't nearly enough votes -

			   LINCOLN
We're whalers, Mr. Ashley!
30.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Whalers? As in, um, whales?

Lincoln moves in, standing very close to Ashley.

			   LINCOLN
We've been chasing this whale for a long time. We've finally placed a harpoon in the monster's back. It's in, James, it's in! We finish the deed now, we can't wait! Or with one flop of his tail he'll smash the boat and send us all to eternity!

			   SEWARD
On the 31st of this month. Of this year. Put the amendment up for a vote.

Ashley is agog.
