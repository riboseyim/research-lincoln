# INT. A BEDROOM IN THE ST. CHARLES HOTEL - LATE NIGHT

Continue with Lincoln and his operatives around the card
table.

			   LINCOLN
Now give me the names of whoever
else you been hunting.

Schell, Latham and Bilbo exchange looks, then:

			   ROBERT LATHAM
George Yeaman.

			   RICHARD SCHELL
Yes. Yeaman.

W.N. BILBO
Among others. But Yeaman: That'd
count.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
			   (HELPFULLY)
			   Y-E-A-M-A-N

Lincoln looks up from his notepad, smiling.

			   LINCOLN
I got it.
95.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
Kentucky.
