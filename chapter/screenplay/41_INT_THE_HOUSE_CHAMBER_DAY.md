# INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - DAY

One representative's reading a paper with the headline: THE
FALLEN AT WILMINGTON, followed by hundreds of names.

Pendleton and Wood are conferring.

			   FERNANDO WOOD
Heavy losses.

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
And more to come.

			   FERNANDO WOOD
Sours the national mood. That might
suffice to discourage him -

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
To what? To bring this down? Not in
a fight like this. This is to the
death.

			   FERNANDO WOOD
It's gruesome!

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
			   (GETTING UPSET:)
Are you despairing, or merely lazy?
This fight is for The United States
of America! Nothing "suffices". A
rumor? Nothing! They're not lazy!
They're busily buying votes! While
we hope to be saved by "the
national mood?!"

He looks over at Stevens, who's at his desk consulting with
Ashley and Julian.
65.

GEORGE PENDLETON (CONT'D)
Before this blood is dry, when
Stevens next takes the floor, taunt
him - you excel at that - get him
to proclaim what we all know he
believes in his coal-colored heart:
that this vote is meant to set the
black race on high, to niggerate
America.

			   FERNANDO WOOD
George, please. Stay on course.

			   GEORGE PENDLETON
Bring Stevens to full froth. I can
ensure that every newspaperman from
Louisville to San Francisco will be
here to witness it and print it.

Colfax gavels the chamber to order, as George Yeaman
approaches the podium.

			   SCHUYLER COLFAX
The floor belongs to the
mellifluent gentleman from
Kentucky, Mr. George Yeaman.

			   GEORGE YEAMAN
I thank you, Speaker Colfax.

The Democrats applaud as Yeaman takes his place at the podium
and surveys the chamber.

GEORGE YEAMAN (CONT'D)
Although I'm disgusted by slavery
I rise on this sad and solemn day
to announce that I'm opposed to the
amendment. We must consider what
will become of colored folk if four
million are in one instant set
free.

Cheers and boos.

ASA VINTNER LITTON
They'll be free, George! That's
what'll become of them! What'll
become of any of us?! That's what
being free means!

Schell, Latham, and Bilbo are perched in their usual gallery
seats, taking notes.
66.

			   RICHARD SCHELL
Think how splendid if Mr. Yeaman
switched.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
(shaking his head:)
Too publicly against us. He can't
change course now.

W.N. BILBO
Not for some miserable little job
anyways.

			   GEORGE YEAMAN
And, and! We will be forced to
enfranchise the men of the colored
race - it would be inhuman not to!
Who among us is prepared to give
Negroes the vote?

He's momentarily silenced by cheers and boos throughout the
chamber.

GEORGE YEAMAN (CONT'D)
And, and! What shall follow upon
that? Universal enfranchisement?
Votes for women?

Yeaman is stopped, baffled and dismayed by the explosion he's
provoked.
