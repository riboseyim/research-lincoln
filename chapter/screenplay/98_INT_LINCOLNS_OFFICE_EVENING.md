# INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE - EVENING

Lincoln's in the shirtsleeves and vest of his formal evening
wear, his hair brushed down and plastered in place. William
Slade is working the tie and gloves. James Ashley and
Schuyler Colfax stand with him, holding glasses of scotch
whiskey. Slade waits with Lincoln's coat, clothes brush, the
stovepipe hat and gloves on the table.

John Hay tears down several of the military maps, heavily
marked, from the bookcases where they're tacked. He drops
these on the floor. As they watch Hay:

			   LINCOLN
I did say some colored men, the
intelligent, the educated, and
veterans, I qualified it.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Mr. Stevens is furious, he wants to
know why you qualified it -

			   SCHUYLER COLFAX
No one heard the intelligent or the
educated part. All they heard was
the first time any president has
ever made mention of Negro voting.

			   LINCOLN
Still, I wish I'd mentioned it in a
better speech.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
Mr. Stevens also wants to know why
you didn't make a better speech.
123.

They laugh. There's a knock on the door; Nicolay enters.

			   JOHN NICOLAY
			   (TO LINCOLN:)
Mrs. Lincoln's waiting in the
carriage. She wants me to remind
you of the hour, and that you'll
have to pick up Miss Harris and
Major Rathbone.

Lincoln nods. Slade enters with Lincoln's hat, coat, and
gloves. Lincoln begins to dress hurriedly.

			   LINCOLN
Am I in trouble?

			   WILLIAM SLADE
No, sir.

			   LINCOLN
Thank you, Mr. Slade.

Slade hands Lincoln his gloves as Colfax and Ashley drain
their drinks and rise.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
I suppose it's time to go, though I
would rather stay.

He leaves the room.
