# INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM, OLD TAVERN IN WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

In a cramped private alcove, a low, sagging timber ceiling, sooty walls, sawdusted floor, ancient curtain closing it off, Seward sits at a small table with ROBERT LATHAM, an Albany NY political operative, RICHARD SCHELL, a Wall Street speculator, and W.N. BILBO, a Tennessee lawyer and lobbyist.A chandelier with candles drips wax on them.

On the table, a leather folio lies open: prospectuses for jobs in the administration. Latham and Schell study these. Bilbo is studying Seward.

			   SEWARD
The President is never to be mentioned. Nor I. You're paid for your discretion.

W.N. BILBO
Hell, you can have that for nothin', what we need money for is bribes. It'd speed things up.

			   SEWARD
No. Nothing strictly illegal.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
It's not illegal to bribe Congressmen. They starve otherwise.

			   RICHARD SCHELL
I have explained to Mr. Bilbo and Mr. Latham that we're offering
patronage jobs to the Dems who vote yes. Jobs and nothing more.

			   SEWARD
That's correct.

W.N. BILBO
Congressmen come cheap! Few thousand bucks'll buy you all you need.

			   SEWARD
The President would be unhappy to hear you did that.

W.N. BILBO
Well, will he be unhappy if we lose?

A WAITRESS brings in a platter of roasted crabs, which she slams down on the table, and leaves.

			   SEWARD
The money I managed to raise for this endeavor is only for your fees, food, and lodgings.

W.N. BILBO
Uh huh. If that squirrel-infested attic you've quartered us in's any
measure, you ain't raised much.

			   RICHARD SCHELL
Shall we get to work?

Bilbo takes a mallet to a crab, smashing it!
