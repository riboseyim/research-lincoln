# INT. HOUSE CHAMBER, THE CAPITOL - LATE MORNING

The chamber's noisy and packed. In the balcony's front row, a
wall of newspapermen, notebooks at the ready.

TITLE: HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

			   JANUARY 27

Ashley, Colfax, and Stevens approach Stevens's desk. Colfax
nods towards the journalists in the balcony:

			   SCHUYLER COLFAX
The World, the Herald and the
Times, New York, Chicago, the
Journal of Commerce, even your
hometown paper's here.

			   JAMES ASHLEY
			   (TO STEVENS:)
Say you believe only in legal
equality for all races, not racial
equality, I beg you, sir.
Compromise. Or you risk it all.

Stevens sees Mary, with Mrs. Keckley, claiming front seats
from two journalists.
