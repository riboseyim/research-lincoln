# INT. THE RIVER QUEEN SALOON, CITY POINT, VIRGINIA - DAY

Grant and the commissioners stand in an expansive cabin at
the stern, patriotically decorated, large windows.

Grant hands the commissioners' peace proposal back to them.
He's scribbled notes all over the document.

			   GRANT
I suggest you work some changes to your proposal before you give it to
the President.

R.M.T HUNTER
We're eager to be on our way to Washington.

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
Did Mr. Lincoln tell you to tell us this, General Grant?

Grant fixes Stephens with a look - bemused, a little disappointed.

			   GRANT
It says..."securing peace for our two countries." And it goes on like
that.

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
I don't know what you -

			   GRANT

I'm fighting to protect it from armed rebels. From you.

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
But Mr. Blair told us, he, he told President Davis we were -

			   GRANT
A private citizen like [Preston Blair](#) can say what he pleases, since he has no authority over anything. If you want to discuss peace with President Lincoln, consider revisions.

He lights a cigar.

			   ALEXANDER STEPHENS
If we're not to discuss a truce between warring nations, what in heaven's name can we discuss?

			   GRANT
Terms of surrender.
