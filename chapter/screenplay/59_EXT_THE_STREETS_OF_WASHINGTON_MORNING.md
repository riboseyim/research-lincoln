# EXT. THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON - MORNING

Lincoln and Robert are in the buggy driven by the old
soldier; a young bodyguard soldier sits beside the driver,
his rifle uselessly tucked under his legs. Lincoln is on one
side reading over a stack of documents. Robert's on the other
side of the buggy, staring sullenly at his feet.

The buggy stops outside an army hospital. Lincoln packs up
his papers.

			   ROBERT
I'm not going in.

			   LINCOLN
You said you wanted to help me.

			   ROBERT
This is - This is just a clumsy
attempt at discouragement. I've
been to army hospitals, I've seen
surgeries, I went and visited the
malaria barges with mama.

			   LINCOLN
She told me she didn't take you
inside.

			   ROBERT
I snuck in after - I've seen what
it's like. This changes nothing.

			   LINCOLN
At all rates, I'm happy to have
your company.

Stepping out of the buggy, he hands his folio to the
bodyguard and enters the army hospital.
