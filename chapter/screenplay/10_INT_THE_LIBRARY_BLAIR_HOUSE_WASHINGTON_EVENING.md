#### INT. THE LIBRARY, BLAIR HOUSE, WASHINGTON - EVENING

Lincoln's perched on the edge of an ottoman.
20.

			   LINCOLN
If the Blairs tell `em to, no
Republican will balk at voting for
the amendment.

The room is baronial. PRESTON BLAIR, patriarch of his wealthy
and powerful family, 72 years old, sits facing his son,
MONTGOMERY BLAIR, 50, whip-thin. A fire blazes in a massive
fireplace behind Monty. Preston's handsome, elegant daughter,
ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE, 45, sits across from Monty, next to Tad,
who's wearing a Union infantryman's uniform, a real musket by
his side.

			   MONTGOMERY BLAIR
No conservative Republican is what
you mean -

			   PRESTON BLAIR
All Republicans ought to be
conservative, I founded this party -
in my own goddamned home - to be a
conservative antislavery party, not
a hobbyhorse for goddamned radical
abolitionists and -

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
Damp down the dyspepsia, daddy,
you'll frighten the child.

			   MONTGOMERY BLAIR
			   (TO LINCOLN:)
You need us to keep the
conservative side of the party in
the traces while you diddle the
radicals and bundle up with
Thaddeus Stevens's gang. You need
our help.

			   LINCOLN
Yes, sir, I do.

			   MONTGOMERY BLAIR
Well, what do we get?

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
Whoo! Blunt! Your manners, Monty,
must be why Mr. Lincoln pushed you
out of his cabinet.

PRESTON BLAIR MONTGOMERY BLAIR
He was pushed out - I wasn't pushed.
21.

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D)
			   (SMILING SARCASTICALLY:)
Oh of course you weren't.

PRESTON BLAIR MONTGOMERY BLAIR
He was pushed out to placate (to Tad:)
the goddamn radical I agreed to resign.
abolishonists!

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D)
(a nod at Tad:)
Oh Daddy, please!

			   PRESTON BLAIR
You don't mind, boy, do you?

			   LINCOLN
He spends his days with soldiers.

			   TAD
They taught me a song!

			   PRESTON BLAIR
Did they? Soldiers know all manner
of songs. How's your brother Bob?

			   TAD
He's at school now, but he's coming
to visit in four days! For the
shindy!

			   PRESTON BLAIR
At school! Ain't that fine! Good
he's not in the army!

			   TAD
Oh he wants to be, but mama said he
			   CAN'T -

			   PRESTON BLAIR
Dangerous life, soldiering.

ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
Your mama is wise to keep him clean
out of that.

			   PRESTON BLAIR
Now your daddy knows that what I
want, in return for all the help I
give him, is to go down to Richmond
like he said I could, soon as
Savannah fell, and talk to
Jefferson Davis. Give me terms I
22.

can offer to Jefferson Davis to
start negotiating for peace. He'll
talk to me!

			   MONTGOMERY BLAIR
Conservative members of your party
want you to listen to overtures
from Richmond. That above all.

Two black servants who have entered begin to pour and serve
tea.

MONTGOMERY BLAIR (CONT'D)
They'll vote for this rash and
dangerous amendment only if every
other possibility is exhausted.

			   PRESTON BLAIR
Our Republicans ain't
abolitionists. We can't tell our
people they can vote yes on
abolishing slavery unless at the
same time we can tell `em that
you're seeking a negotiated peace.

The Blairs look at Lincoln, waiting for an answer.
