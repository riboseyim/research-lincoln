# INT. THE TELEGRAPH ROOM, WAR DEPARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

Lincoln is seated at Eckert's desk, shawl wrapped around his
shoulders, glasses on; he stares down into his hat, held
between his knees. Homer Bates and Sam Beckwith are waiting
for him.

Lincoln draws a handwritten note from his hat and carefully
unfolds it.

			   LINCOLN
"Lieutenant General Ulysses S.
Grant, City Po# INT. I have read your
words with interest."

Sam Beckwith transcribes Lincoln's words into code on a pad
with a pencil.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
"I ask that, regardless of any
action I take in the matter of the
visit of the Richmond
commissioners, you maintain among
your troops military preparedness
for battle, as you have done until
now."

He stops for a moment. Beckwith waits, pencil poised.

Lincoln looks at the note, folds it, tucks it in a band
inside his hat.
75.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
"Have Captain Saunders convey the
commissioners to me here in
Washington."
			   (ANOTHER PAUSE)
"A. Lincoln." And the date.

			   SAMUEL BECKWITH
			   (WHILE WRITING:)
Yes sir.

Lincoln places the hat on the floor.

SAMUEL BECKWITH (CONT'D)
Shall I transmit, sir?

			   LINCOLN
(a beat, then:)
You think we choose to be born?

			   SAMUEL BECKWITH
I don't suppose so.

			   LINCOLN
Are we fitted to the times we're
born into?

			   SAMUEL BECKWITH
I don't know about myself. You may
be, sir. Fitted.

			   LINCOLN
			   (TO HOMER:)
What do you reckon?

			   HOMER BATES
I'm an engineer. I reckon there's
machinery but no one's done the
fitting.

			   LINCOLN
You're an engineer, you must know
Euclid's axioms and common notions.

			   HOMER BATES
I must've in school, but...

			   LINCOLN
I never had much of schooling, but
I read Euclid, in an old book I
borrowed. Little enough ever found
its way in here -
(touching his cranium)
- but once learnt it stayed learnt.
76.

Euclid's first common notion is
this: "Things which are equal to
the same thing are equal to each
other."

Homer doesn't get it; neither does Sam.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
That's a rule of mathematical
reasoning. It's true because it
works; has done and always will do.
In his book, Euclid says this is
"self-evident."
			   (A BEAT)
D'you see? There it is, even in
that two-thousand year old book of
mechanical law: it is a self-
evident truth that things which are
equal to the same thing are equal
to each other. We begin with
equality. That's the origin, isn't
it? That balance, that's fairness,
that's justice.

He looks at his scribbled note, then at Sam and Homer.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
Read me the last sentence of my
telegram.

			   SAMUEL BECKWITH
"Have Captain Saunders convey the
commissioners to me here in
Washington."

			   LINCOLN
A slight emendation, Sam, if you would.

Beckwith writes as Lincoln dictates.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
"Have Captain Saunders convey the
gentlemen aboard the River Queen as
far as Hampton Roads, Virginia, and
there wait until..."
			   (BEAT)
"...further advice from me. Do not
proceed to Washington."
77.
