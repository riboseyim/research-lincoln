# EXT. THE PORTICO OF THE WHITE HOUSE - A SHORT WHILE LATER

The carriage has pulled up and Mary is entering the White
House. Lincoln helps Mrs. Keckley down from the carriage.

She hesitates before proceeding in. Then she faces Lincoln.

			   ELIZABETH KECKLEY
I know the vote is only four days
away; I know you're concerned.
Thank you for your concern over
this, and I want you to know:
They'll approve it. God will see
to it.

			   LINCOLN
I don't envy him his task. He may
wish He'd chosen an instrument for
His purpose more wieldy than the
House of Representatives.

			   ELIZABETH KECKLEY
Then you'll see to it.
88.

Lincoln looks at her, considering. Then:

			   LINCOLN
Are you afraid of what lies ahead?
For your people? If we succeed?

			   ELIZABETH KECKLEY
White people don't want us here.

			   LINCOLN
Many don't.

			   ELIZABETH KECKLEY
What about you?

			   LINCOLN
I...I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley.
Any of you. You're ...familiar to
me, as all people are.
Unaccommodated, poor, bare, forked
creatures such as we all are. You
have a right to expect what I
expect, and likely our expectations
are not incomprehensible to each
other. I assume I'll get used to
you. But what you are to the
nation, what'll become of you once
slavery's day is done, I don't
know.

			   ELIZABETH KECKLEY
What my people are to be, I can't
say. Negroes have been fighting and
dying for freedom since the first
of us was a slave. I never heard
any ask what freedom will bring.
Freedom's first. As for me: My son
died, fighting for the Union,
wearing the Union blue. For freedom
he died. I'm his mother. That's
what I am to the nation, Mr.
Lincoln. What else must I be?
