# INT. SEWARD'S OFFICE, STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY

Seward sits at his grand desk, looking on with an anxious
scowl. Lincoln sits on the edge of Seward's desk. Yeaman sits
in a chair facing him.

			   GEORGE YEAMAN
I can't vote for the amendment, Mr.
Lincoln.

			   LINCOLN
I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman,
filled with colored men in chains,
heading down the Mississippi to the
New Orleans slave markets. It
sickened me, \`n more than that, it
brought a shadow down, a pall
around my eyes.
			   (BEAT)
Slavery troubled me, as long as I
can remember, in a way it never
troubled my father, though he hated
it. In his own fashion. He knew no
smallholding dirt farmer could
compete with slave plantations. He
took us out from Kentucky to get
away from \`em. He wanted Indiana
kept free. He wasn't a kind man,
but there was a rough moral urge
for fairness, for freedom in him. I
learnt that from him, I suppose, if
little else from him. We didn't
care for one another, Mr. Yeaman.

			   GEORGE YEAMAN
			   (EMBARRASSED)
I... Well, I'm sorry to hear that -

			   LINCOLN
Lovingkindness, that most ordinary
thing, came to me from other
sources. I'm grateful for that.

			   GEORGE YEAMAN
I hate it, too, sir, slavery, but -
but we're entirely unready for
emancipation. There's too many
			   QUESTIONS -
96.

			   LINCOLN
			   (LAUGHS)
We're unready for peace too, ain't
we? When it comes, it'll present us
with conundrums and dangers greater
than any we've faced during the
war, bloody as it's been. We'll
have to extemporize and experiment
with what it is when it is.

Lincoln moves from the desk to take the seat beside Yeaman,
no longer towering over him. He leans forward and rests a
hand on Yeaman's knee.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
I read your speech, George. Negroes
and the vote, that's a puzzle.

			   GEORGE YEAMAN
No, no, but, but, but - But Negroes
can't, um, vote, Mr. Lincoln.
You're not suggesting that we
enfranchise colored people.

			   LINCOLN
I'm asking only that you
disenthrall yourself from the slave
powers. I'll let you know when
there's an offer on my desk for
surrender.
There's none before us now. What's
before us now, that's the vote on
the Thirteenth Amendment. It's
going to be so very close.
You see what you can do.

Lincoln leaves Yeaman, considering.
