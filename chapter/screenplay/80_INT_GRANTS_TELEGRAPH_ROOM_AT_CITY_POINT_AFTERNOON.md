# INT. GRANT'S TELEGRAPH ROOM AT CITY POINT - AFTERNOON

OFFICERS are crowded in the small room, watching a SERGEANT transcribe as his cipher key clicks.

			   SERGEANT
Webster Allen, Illinois, Democrat, votes...no.

The cipher key clicks again.

			   SERGEANT (CONT'D)
Halberd Law, Indiana, Democrat, votes...no.

Grant observes this from the balcony above. Robert, in a captain's uniform, stands near him. Like his mother, Robert has a scorecard, and he's keeping track.

Grant turns his back on the proceedings to light a cigar. He's concerned at how close the vote is. Behind him the count
			  CONTINUES:

			   SERGEANT (CONT'D)
Archibald Moran...yes.

Robert has been looking at Grant; he returns to his score keeping.

			   SERGEANT (CONT'D)
Ambrose Bailer...yes.
