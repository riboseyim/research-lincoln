# INT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

The room's cozy, attractive, cluttered, part dressmaker's workshop, part repository of Mary's endless purchases: clothing, fabrics, knicknacks, carpets. Books everywhere.

Lincoln reclines on a French chair, too small for his lengthy frame. He's in shirtsleeves, vest unbuttoned and tie unknotted, shoeless. He has an open folio filled with documents on his lap.

MARY LINCOLN sits opposite, in a nightgown, housecoat and night cap. She watches him in her vanity mirror.

She looks frightened.

#### TITLE:THE WHITE HOUSE

			   LINCOLN
I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space...were it not that I have bad dreams. I reckon it's the speed that's strange to me. I'm used to going a deliberate pace.

Mary looks at him, stricken with alarm.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
I should spare you. I shouldn't tell you my dreams.

			   MARY
I don't want to be spared if you aren't! And you spare me nothing. He looks down at the carpet, then back up at her.

			   MARY (CONT'D)
Perhaps perhaps it's the assault on Wilmington port. You dream about the ship before a battle, usually.

 		   LINCOLN
(rapping lightly on his  FOREHEAD:) How's the coconut?

			   MARY
Beyond description. She delicately touches her head.

			   MARY (CONT'D)
Almost two years, nothing mends. Another casualty of the war. Who wants to listen to a useless woman grouse about her carriage accident?

			   LINCOLN
I do.

			   MARY
Stuff! You tell me dreams, that's all, I'm your soothsayer, that's all I am anymore, I'm not to be trusted with - Even if it wasn't a carriage accident, even if it was an attempted assassination -

			   LINCOLN
It was most probably an -

			   MARY
It was an assassin. Whose intended target was you.

			   LINCOLN
How's the plans for the big shindy progressing?

			   MARY
I don't want to talk about parties! You don't care about parties.

			   LINCOLN
Not much but they're a necessary - Mary studies Lincoln, thinking. Then a revelation:

			   MARY
I know...I know what it's about. The ship, it isn't Wilmington Port, it's not a military campaign! It's the amendment to abolish slavery! Why else would you force me to invite demented radicals into my home?

Lincoln closes his folio.

			   MARY (CONT'D)
You're going to try to get the amendment passed in the House of Representatives, before the term ends, before the Inauguration.

			   LINCOLN(STANDING:)
Don't spend too much money on the flubdubs. Mary stands, goes up to him.

			   MARY
No one's loved as much as you, no one's ever been loved so much, by the people, you might do anything now. Don't, don't waste that power on an amendment bill that's sure of defeat.

Seeing that he's not going to discuss this, she turns away,walking to an open window.

			   MARY (CONT'D)
Did you remember Robert's coming home for the reception?

Lincoln nods, though Mary isn't bothering to look at him.

			   MARY (CONT'D)
I knew you'd forget. She closes the window.

			   MARY (CONT'D)
That's the ship you're sailing on.The Thirteenth Amendment. You needn't tell me I'm right. I know I am.

She watches as he leaves the room, smiling in bitter victory:she's right.
