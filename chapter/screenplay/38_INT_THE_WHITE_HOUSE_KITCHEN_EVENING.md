# INT. THE WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN - EVENING

The kitchen's piled with unwashed cookware, eggshells, flour
bins, muffin and pastry molds, spoons and knives, the
detritus of the preparations for the finger food served at
the reception, which has now transitioned into a dance and is
still underway upstairs. Music, the tramp of dancing feet and
rhythmic clapping is audible.

A BLACK FOOTMAN carrying a huge tray laden with dishes and
cups comes down the stairs. He hastily beats a retreat when
he sees Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens quietly talking amid the
mess.
58.

			   LINCOLN
Since we have the floor next in the
debate, I thought I'd suggest you
might...temper your contributions
so as not to frighten our
conservative friends?

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
Ashley insists you're ensuring
approval by dispensing patronage to
otherwise undeserving Democrats.

			   LINCOLN
I can't ensure a single damn thing
if you scare the whole House with
talk of land appropriations and
revolutionary tribunals and
punitive thisses and thats -

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
When the war ends, I intend to push
for full equality, the Negro vote
and much more. Congress shall
mandate the seizure of every foot
of rebel land and every dollar of
their property. We'll use their
confiscated wealth to establish
hundreds of thousands of free Negro
farmers, and at their side soldiers
armed to occupy and transform the
heritage of traitors. We'll build
up a land down there of free men
and free women and free children
and freedom.
The nation needs to know that we
have such plans.

			   LINCOLN
That's the untempered version of
reconstruction. It's not... It's
not exactly what I intend, but we
shall oppose one another in the
course of time. Now we're working
together, and I'm asking you -

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
For patience, I expect.

			   LINCOLN
When the people disagree, bringing
them together requires going slow
till they're ready to make up -
59.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
Ah, shit on the people and what
they want and what they're ready
for! I don't give a goddamn about
the people and what they want! This
is the face of someone who has
fought long and hard for the good
of the people without caring much
for any of \`em. And I look a lot
worse without the wig. The people
elected me! To represent them! To
lead them! And I lead! You ought to
try it!

			   LINCOLN
I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens,
and I have tried to profit from the
example of it. But if I'd listened
to you, I'd've declared every slave
free the minute the first shell
struck Fort Sumter; then the border
states would've gone over to the
confederacy, the war would've been
lost and the Union along with it,
and instead of abolishing slavery,
as we hope to do, in two weeks,
we'd be watching helpless as
infants as it spread from the
American South into South America.

Stevens glares at him, then smiles.

			   THADDEUS STEVENS
Oh, how you have longed to say that
to me. You claim you trust them -
but you know what the people are.
You know that the inner compass
that should direct the soul toward
justice has ossified in white men
and women, north and south, unto
utter uselessness through
tolerating the evil of slavery.
White people cannot bear the
thought of sharing this country's
infinite abundance with Negroes.

Lincoln reaches over to Stevens and gives his shoulder a
vigorous shake. Stevens endures this.

			   LINCOLN
A compass, I learnt when I was
surveying, it'll - it'll point you
True North from where you're
standing, but it's got no advice
60.

about the swamps and deserts and
chasms that you'll encounter along
the way. If in pursuit of your
destination you plunge ahead,
heedless of obstacles, and achieve
nothing more than to sink in a
swamp, what's the use of knowing
True North?
