# EXT. A BUGGY RIDE THROUGH WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON

A beautiful spring afternoon. Lincoln and Mary are riding in
the buggy, driven by the old soldier.

			   MARY
You've an itch to travel?

			   LINCOLN
I'd like that. To the West by rail.

			   MARY
(shaking her head no:)
Overseas.

			   LINCOLN
The Holy Land.

			   MARY
(a laugh, then:)
Awfully pious for a man who takes
his wife out buggy-riding on Good
Friday.

			   LINCOLN
Jerusalem. Where David and Solomon
walked. I dream of walking in that
ancient city.

She seems sadder. They ride in silence.

			   MARY
All anyone will remember of me is I
was crazy and I ruined your
happiness.

			   LINCOLN
Anyone thinks that doesn't
understand, Molly.

She nods; then, tenderly:
122.

			   MARY
When they look at you, at what it
cost to live at the heart of this,
they'll wonder at it. They'll
wonder at you. They should. But
they should also look at the
wretched woman by your side, if
they want to understand what this
was truly like. For an ordinary
person. For anyone other than you.

Lincoln laughs, takes her hand. She leans against him.

			   LINCOLN
We must try to be happier. We
must. Both of us. We've been so
miserable for so long.
