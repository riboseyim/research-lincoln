# EXT. A WOODS ALONG THE POTOMAC RIVER - MORNING

Bilbo walks with Clay Hawkins, who peruses the folio. Bilbo
has a small covered wicker basket slung over his shoulder.
Hawkins follows, happy and sick with fear.

			   CLAY HAWKINS
T-tax collector for the Western
Reserve. Th-th-that pays
handsomely.

W.N. BILBO
Don't just reach for the highest
branches. They sway in every
breeze. Assistant Port Inspector of
Marlston looks like the ticket to
me.

			   CLAY HAWKINS
Uh, boats, they, they make me sick.

Bilbo retrieves a snare; a small bird is trapped by the foot.
Bilbo stuffs the bird in the basket.

CLAY HAWKINS (CONT'D)
So just stand on the dock. Let the
Assistant Assistant Port
Inspector's stomach go weak.

Bilbo eyes Hawkins, who anxiously eyes the folio.
