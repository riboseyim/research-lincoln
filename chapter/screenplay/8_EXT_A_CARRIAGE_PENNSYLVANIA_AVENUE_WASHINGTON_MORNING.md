# EXT. A CARRIAGE, PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, WASHINGTON - MORNING

In a four-door carriage, top down, Seward sits opposite Lincoln. Hay, next to Seward, organizes papers in a portfolio on his lap.

			   SEWARD
Even if every Republican in the House votes yes - far from guaranteed, since when has our party unanimously supported anything? - but say all our fellow Republicans vote for it. We'd still be twenty votes short.

			   LINCOLN
Only twenty.

			   SEWARD
Only twenty!

			   LINCOLN
We can find twenty votes.

			   SEWARD
Twenty House Democrats who'll vote to abolish slavery! In my opinion -

			   LINCOLN
To which I always listen.

			   SEWARD
Or pretend to.

			   LINCOLN
With all three of my ears.

			   SEWARD
We'll win the war soon - It's inevitable, isn't it?

			   LINCOLN
Ain't won yit.

			   SEWARD
You'll begin your second term with semi-divine stature. Imagine the possibilities peace will bring! Why tarnish your invaluable luster with a battle in the House? It's a rats' nest in there, the same gang of talentless hicks and hacks that rejected the amendment ten months back. We'll lose.

Lincoln smiles.

			   LINCOLN
I like our chances now.
