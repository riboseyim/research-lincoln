# INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

The cabinet has assembled. Lincoln heads the table, Seward at
his left and EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War, 51, barrel-
shaped, long bearded, bespectacled, at his right. Next to him
are Secretary of the Navy GIDEON WELLES, 63, luxurious white
hair (it's a wig) and a flowing snowy beard; Postmaster
General WILLIAM DENNISON, 50; Secretary of the Interior JOHN
USHER, 49; Secretary of the Treasury WILLIAM FESSENDEN, 59;
and Attorney General JAMES SPEED, 53.

Nicolay and Hay are in chairs behind Lincoln, taking notes.

			   LINCOLN
			   (TO STANTON:)
Thunder forth, God of War!

Stanton clears his throat. He's noticed the singed edge.

			   STANTON
We'll commence our assault on Wilmington from the sea.
			   (PEEVED:)
Why is this burnt? Was the boy playing with it?

			   LINCOLN
It got took by a breeze several nights back.

			   STANTON
This is an official War Department map!
24.

			   SEWARD
And the entire cabinet's waiting to
hear what it portends.

			   WELLES
A bombardment. From the largest
fleet the Navy has ever assembled.

			   LINCOLN
			   (TO WELLES:)
Old Neptune! Shake thy hoary locks!

Welles stands.

			   WELLES
Fifty-eight ships are underway, of
every tonnage and firing range.

Welles gestures on the map to the positions of many ships.

			   STANTON
We'll keep up a steady barrage. Our
first target is Fort Fisher. It
defends Wilmington Port.

Stanton indicates the lines tracing artillery trajectories.
These converge particularly heavily on Fort Fisher.

			   JAMES SPEED
A steady barrage?

			   STANTON
A hundred shells a minute.

There's a moment of shocked silence.

			   STANTON (CONT'D)
Till they surrender.

			   WILLIAM FESSENDEN
Dear God.

			   WELLES
Yes. Yes.

			   LINCOLN
Wilmington's their last open
seaport. Therefore...

			   STANTON
Wilmington falls, Richmond falls
after.
25.

			   SEWARD
And the war... is done.

The rest of the cabinet applauds, foot stomping, table
slapping. Only John Usher doesn't join in.

			   JOHN USHER
Then why, if I may ask are we not
concentrating the nation's
attention on Wilmington? Why,
instead, are we reading in the
			   HERALD -
(he smacks a newspaper on
			   THE TABLE)
- that the anti-slavery amendment
is being precipitated onto the
House floor for debate - because
your eagerness, in what seems an
unwarranted intrusion of the
Executive into Legislative
prerogatives, is compelling it to
it's... to what's likely to be its
premature demise? You signed the
Emancipation Proclamation, you've
done all that can be expected -

			   JAMES SPEED
The Emancipation Proclamation's
merely a war measure. After the war
the courts'll make a meal of it.

			   JOHN USHER
When Edward Bates was Attorney
General, he felt confident in it
enough to allow you to sign -

			   JAMES SPEED
			   (A SHRUG:)
Different lawyers, different
opinions. It frees slaves as a
military exigent, not in any other -

			   LINCOLN
I don't recall Bates being any too
certain about the legality of my
Proclamation, just it wasn't
downright criminal. Somewhere's in
between. Back when I rode the legal
circuit in Illinois I defended a
woman from Metamora named Melissa
Goings, 77 years old, they said she
murdered her husband; he was 83. He
was choking her; and, uh, she
grabbed ahold of a stick of fire-
26.

wood and fractured his skull, `n he
died. In his will he wrote "I
expect she has killed me. If I get
over it, I will have revenge."

This gets a laugh.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
No one was keen to see her
convicted, he was that kind of
husband. I asked the prosecuting
attorney if I might have a short
conference with my client. And she
and I went into a room in the
courthouse, but I alone emerged.
The window in the room was found to
be wide open. It was believed the
old lady may have climbed out of
it. I told the bailiff right before
I left her in the room she asked me
where she could get a good drink of
water, and I told her Tennessee.
Mrs. Goings was seen no more in
Metamora. Enough justice had been
done; they even forgave the
bondsman her bail.

			   JOHN USHER
I'm afraid I don't -

			   LINCOLN
I decided that the Constitution
gives me war powers, but no one
knows just exactly what those
powers are. Some say they don't
exist. I don't know. I decided I
needed them to exist to uphold my
oath to protect the Constitution,
which I decided meant that I could
take the rebels' slaves from `em as
property confiscated in war. That
might recommend to suspicion that I
agree with the rebs that their
slaves are property in the first
place. Of course I don't, never
have, I'm glad to see any man free,
and if calling a man property, or
war contraband, does the trick...
Why I caught at the opportunity.
Now here's where it gets truly
slippery. I use the law allowing
for the seizure of property in a
war knowing it applies only to the
property of governments and
27.

citizens of belligerent nations.
But the South ain't a nation,
that's why I can't negotiate with
'em. So if in fact the Negroes are
property according to law, have I
the right to take the rebels'
property from `em, if I insist
they're rebels only, and not
citizens of a belligerent country?
And slipperier still: I maintain it
ain't our actual Southern states in
rebellion, but only the rebels
living in those states, the laws of
which states remain in force. The
laws of which states remain in
force. That means, that since it's
states' laws that determine whether
Negroes can be sold as slaves, as
property - the Federal government
doesn't have a say in that, least
not yet -
(a glance at Seward,
			   THEN:)
- then Negroes in those states are
slaves, hence property, hence my
war powers allow me to confiscate
`em as such. So I confiscated `em.
But if I'm a respecter of states'
laws, how then can I legally free
`em with my Proclamation, as I
done, unless I'm cancelling states'
laws? I felt the war demanded it;
my oath demanded it; I felt right
with myself; and I hoped it was
legal to do it, I'm hoping still.

He looks around the table. Everyone's listening.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
Two years ago I proclaimed these
people emancipated - "then,
thenceforward and forever free."
But let's say the courts decide I
had no authority to do it. They
might well decide that. Say there's
no amendment abolishing slavery.
Say it's after the war, and I can
no longer use my war powers to just
ignore the courts' decisions, like
I sometimes felt I had to do. Might
those people I freed be ordered
back into slavery? That's why I'd
like to get the Thirteenth
Amendment through the House, and on
28.

its way to ratification by the
states, wrap the whole slavery
thing up, forever and aye. As soon
as I'm able. Now. End of this
month. And I'd like you to stand
behind me. Like my cabinet's most
always done.

A moment's silence, broken by a sharp laugh from Seward.

			   LINCOLN (CONT'D)
As the preacher said, I could write
shorter sermons but once I start I
get too lazy to stop.

			   JOHN USHER
It seems to me, sir, you're
describing precisely the sort of
dictator the Democrats have been
howling about.

			   JAMES SPEED
Dictators aren't susceptible to
law.

			   JOHN USHER
Neither is he! He just said as
much! Ignoring the courts? Twisting
meanings? What reins him in from,
from...

			   LINCOLN
Well, the people do that, I
suppose. I signed the Emancipation
Proclamation a year and half before
my second election. I felt I was
within my power to do it; however I
also felt that I might be wrong
about that; I knew the people would
tell me. I gave `em a year and half
to think about it. And they re-
elected me.
			   (BEAT)
And come February the first, I
intend to sign the Thirteenth
Amendment.
