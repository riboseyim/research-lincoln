# EXT. IN A BACK ALLEY, SOMEWHERE IN WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON

Seward, now inside the carriage, slams the door.

			   SEWARD
Perhaps you push too hard.

W.N. BILBO
I push nobody. Perhaps we need
reinforcements. If Jeff Davis wants
to cease hostilities, who do you
think'll give a genuine solid shit
to free slaves?
69.

			   SEWARD
Get back to it, and good day,
gentlemen.

Schell and Latham lean in to the carriage.

			   RICHARD SCHELL
We are at an impasse.

			   ROBERT LATHAM
Tell Lincoln to deny the rumors.
Publicly.

			   RICHARD SCHELL
Tell us what you expect of us.

			   SEWARD
I expect you to do your work! And
to have sufficient sense and taste
not to presume to instruct the
President. Or me.

Schell steps up on the running board, intent.

			   RICHARD SCHELL
Is there a Confederate offer or
not?
