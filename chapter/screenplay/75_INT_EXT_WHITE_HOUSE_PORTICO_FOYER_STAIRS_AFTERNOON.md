INT/EXT. WHITE HOUSE PORTICO, FOYER, STAIRS - AFTERNOON

Bilbo puffs his way across the portico, through the door, and
up the stairs. Hay gains on him. It's become a race!

In the second floor hallway, Bilbo gets winded, and Hay
dashes past him. Hay reaches the doors to Lincoln's office
and flings them open.
