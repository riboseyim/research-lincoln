## About Lincoln
Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin’s best-selling biography, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, Steven Spielberg directs Lincoln, a revealing drama that focuses on the 16th President’s tumultuous final months in office. In a nation divided by war and the strong winds of change, Lincoln pursues a course of action designed to end the war, unite the country and abolish slavery. With the moral courage and fierce determination to succeed, his choices during this critical moment will change the fate of generations to come. Starring Academy Award® winners Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones along with Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Inception) and David Strathairn (The Bourne Ultimatum).

## About The Score
In a career spanning almost six decades, John Williams has composed some of the most recognizable film scores in the history of motion pictures including Star Wars, Jaws, the Indiana Jones films, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler’s List and the first three Harry Potter films. Winner of twenty-one Grammy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards and five Academy Awards, Williams is easily the most recognized composer working in film today. He has a long association with Steven Spielberg, composing music for all but two of Spielberg’s feature films, most recently on the Academy Award -nominated scores for The Adventures of Tintin and Warhorse.
